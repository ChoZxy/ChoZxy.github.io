Hi, Vince,

How are you doing? I called Wed to set up a meeting with you, unfortunately 
you were out of town. Since I just got my computer and email account set up 
today, it was not that convenient to contact you. Please let me know when you 
are available. Please see the following for the interesting article about 
Enron, and it is exactly what you have been worried about and now it is 
starting to catch Wall Street's attention. So I belive what you have been 
promoting to do is very constructive to the company.

In addition, please let me know if you need any help with Tiger Team. I 
didn't forget yesterday's conference, but I was so tied up in a meeting and 
couldn't leave. The learning curve is quite steep for a freshhand like me at 
the very beginning. 

You are such a remarkable person, and I feel lucky I got the chance to work 
for you. I really appreciate your help and your kindness to me, and I benefit 
from it tremendously. Please please let me know if there is anything I could 
help.

Best Wishes!

Li

Is Enron Overpriced?
It's in a bunch of complex businesses. Its financial
statements are nearly impenetrable. So why is Enron
trading at such a huge multiple?
Bethany McLean

03/05/2001
Fortune Magazine

(Copyright 2001)

   In Hollywood parlance, the ""It Girl"" is someone who commands the
spotlight at any given moment--you know, like Jennifer Lopez or Kate
Hudson. Wall Street is a far less glitzy place, but there's still
such a thing as an ""It Stock."" Right now, that title belongs to
Enron, the Houston energy giant. While tech stocks were bombing at
the box office last year, fans couldn't get enough of Enron, whose
shares returned 89%. By almost every measure, the company turned in a
virtuoso performance: Earnings increased 25%, and revenues more than
doubled, to over $100 billion. Not surprisingly, the critics are
gushing. ""Enron has built unique and, in our view, extraordinary
franchises in several business units in very large markets,"" says
Goldman Sachs analyst David Fleischer.

   Along with ""It"" status come high multiples and high expectations.
Enron now trades at roughly 55 times trailing earnings. That's more
than 2 1/2 times the multiple of a competitor like Duke Energy, more
than twice that of the S&P 500, and about on a par with new-economy
sex symbol Cisco Systems. Enron has an even higher opinion of itself.
At a late-January meeting with analysts in Houston, the company
declared that it should be valued at $126 a share, more than 50%
above current levels. ""Enron has no shame in telling you what it's
worth,"" says one portfolio manager, who describes such gatherings as
""revival meetings."" Indeed, First Call says that 13 of Enron's 18
analysts rate the stock a buy.
   But for all the attention that's lavished on Enron, the company
remains largely impenetrable to outsiders, as even some of its
admirers are quick to admit. Start with a pretty straightforward
question: How exactly does Enron make its money? Details are hard to
come by because Enron keeps many of the specifics confidential for
what it terms ""competitive reasons."" And the numbers that Enron does
present are often extremely complicated. Even quantitatively minded
Wall Streeters who scrutinize the company for a living think so. ""If
you figure it out, let me know,"" laughs credit analyst Todd Shipman
at S&P. ""Do you have a year?"" asks Ralph Pellecchia, Fitch's credit
analyst, in response to the same question.

   To skeptics, the lack of clarity raises a red flag about Enron's
pricey stock. Even owners of the stock aren't uniformly sanguine.
""I'm somewhat afraid of it,"" admits one portfolio manager. And the
inability to get behind the numbers combined with ever higher
expectations for the company may increase the chance of a nasty
surprise. ""Enron is an earnings-at-risk story,'' says Chris Wolfe,
the equity market strategist at J.P. Morgan's private bank, who
despite his remark is an Enron fan. ""If it doesn't meet earnings,
[the stock] could implode.""

   What's clear is that Enron isn't the company it was a decade ago.
In 1990 around 80% of its revenues came from the regulated gas-
pipeline business. But Enron has been steadily selling off its old-
economy iron and steel assets and expanding into new areas. In 2000,
95% of its revenues and more than 80% of its operating profits came
from ""wholesale energy operations and services."" This business, which
Enron pioneered, is usually described in vague, grandiose terms like
the ""financialization of energy""--but also, more simply, as ""buying
and selling gas and electricity."" In fact, Enron's view is that it
can create a market for just about anything; as if to underscore that
point, the company announced last year that it would begin trading
excess broadband capacity.

   But describing what Enron does isn't easy, because what it does is
mind-numbingly complex. CEO Jeff Skilling calls Enron a ""logistics
company"" that ties together supply and demand for a given commodity
and figures out the most cost-effective way to transport that
commodity to its destination. Enron also uses derivatives, like
swaps, options, and forwards, to create contracts for third parties
and to hedge its exposure to credit risks and other variables. If you
thought Enron was just an energy company, have a look at its SEC
filings. In its 1999 annual report the company wrote that ""the use of
financial instruments by Enron's businesses may expose Enron to
market and credit risks resulting from adverse changes in commodity
and equity prices, interest rates, and foreign exchange rates.""

   Analyzing Enron can be deeply frustrating. ""It's very difficult
for us on Wall Street with as little information as we have,"" says
Fleischer, who is a big bull. (The same is true for Enron's
competitors, but ""wholesale operations"" are usually a smaller part of
their business, and they trade at far lower multiples.) ""Enron is a
big black box,"" gripes another analyst. Without having access to each
and every one of Enron's contracts and its minute-by-minute
activities, there isn't any way to independently answer critical
questions about the company. For instance, many Wall Streeters
believe that the current volatility in gas and power markets is
boosting Enron's profits, but there is no way to know for sure. ""The
ability to develop a somewhat predictable model of this business for
the future is mostly an exercise in futility,"" wrote Bear Stearns
analyst Robert Winters in a recent report.

   To some observers, Enron resembles a Wall Street firm. Indeed,
people commonly refer to the company as ""the Goldman Sachs of energy
trading."" That's meant as a compliment. But the fact that part of
Goldman's business is inherently risky and impenetrable to outsiders
is precisely the reason that Goldman, despite its powerful franchise,
trades at 17 times trailing earnings--or less than one-third of
Enron's P/E. And as Long Term Capital taught us, the best-laid
hedges, even those designed by geniuses, can go disastrously wrong.
""Trying to get a good grip on Enron's risk profile is challenging,""
says Shipman.

   Nor at the moment is Enron's profitability close to that of
brokerages (which, in fairness, do tend to be more leveraged). While
Wall Street firms routinely earn north of 20% returns on their equity-
-Goldman's ROE last year was 27%--Enron's rate for the 12 months
ended in September (the last period for which balance sheet
information is available) was 13%. Even less appealing is Enron's
return on invested capital (a measure including debt), which is
around 7%. That's about the same rate of return you get on far less
risky U.S. Treasuries.

   Enron vehemently disagrees with any characterization of its
business as black box-like. It also dismisses any comparison to a
securities firm. ""We are not a trading company,"" CFO Andrew Fastow
emphatically declares. In Enron's view, its core business--where the
company says it makes most of its money--is delivering a physical
commodity, something a Goldman Sachs doesn't do. And unlike a trading
firm, which thrives when prices are going wild, Enron says that
volatility has no effect on its profits--other than to increase
customers, who flock to the company in turbulent times. Both
Skilling, who describes Enron's wholesale business as ""very simple to
model,"" and Fastow note that the growth in Enron's profitability
tracks the growth in its volumes almost perfectly. ""People who raise
questions are people who have not gone through [our business] in
detail and who want to throw rocks at us,"" says Skilling. Indeed,
Enron dismisses criticism as ignorance or as sour grapes on the part
of analysts who failed to win its investment-banking business. The
company also blames short-sellers for talking down Enron. As for the
details about how it makes money, Enron says that's proprietary
information, sort of like Coca-Cola's secret formula. Fastow, who
points out that Enron has 1,217 trading ""books"" for different
commodities, says, ""We don't want anyone to know what's on those
books. We don't want to tell anyone where we're making money.""

   In addition to its commodities business, Enron has another
division called Assets and Investments that is every bit as
mysterious. This business involves building power plants around the
world, operating them, selling off pieces of them, ""invest[ing] in
debt and equity securities of energy and communications-related
business,"" as Enron's filings note, and other things.

   Actually, analysts don't seem to have a clue what's in Assets and
Investments or, more to the point, what sort of earnings it will
generate. Enron's results from that part of its business tend to be
quite volatile--profits fell from $325 million in the second quarter
of 1999 to $55 million in the second quarter of 2000. In written
reports, Morgan Stanley chalked up the decline to the poor
performance of Enron's ""significant number of investments"" in telecom
stocks; Dain Rauscher Wessels blamed it on a lack of asset sales.

   In any event, some analysts seem to like the fact that Enron has
some discretion over the results it reports in this area. In a
footnote to its 1999 financials, Enron notes that it booked ""pretax
gains from sales of merchant assets and investments totaling $756
million, $628 million, and $136 million"" in 1999, 1998, and 1997.
""This is an enormous earnings vehicle, which can often be called upon
when and if market conditions require,"" notes UBS Warburg analyst Ron
Barone. Not everyone is so chipper. ""We are concerned they are
liquidating their asset base and booking it as recurring revenue,
especially in Latin America,"" says analyst Andre Meade at Commerzbank-
-who has a hold rating on the stock. At the least, these sorts of
hard-to-predict earnings are usually assigned a lower multiple.

   There are other concerns: Despite the fact that Enron has been
talking about reducing its debt, in the first nine months of 2000 its
debt went up substantially. During this period, Enron issued a net
$3.9 billion in debt, bringing its total debt up to a net $13 billion
at the end of September and its debt-to-capital ratio up to 50%, vs.
39% at the end of 1999. Nor does Enron make life easy for those who
measure the health of a business by its cash flow from operations. In
1999 its cash flow from operations fell from $1.6 billion the
previous year to $1.2 billion. In the first nine months of 2000, the
company generated just $100 million in cash. (In fact, cash flow
would have been negative if not for the $410 million in tax breaks it
received from employees' exercising their options.)

   But Enron says that extrapolating from its financial statements is
misleading. The fact that Enron's cash flow this year was meager, at
least when compared with earnings, was partly a result of its
wholesale business. Accounting standards mandate that its assets and
liabilities from its wholesale business be ""marked to market""--
valued at their market price at a given moment in time. Changes in
the valuation are reported in earnings. But these earnings aren't
necessarily cash at the instant they are recorded. Skilling says that
Enron can convert these contracts to cash anytime it chooses by
""securitizing"" them, or selling them off to a financial institution.
Enron then receives a ""servicing fee,"" but Skilling says that all the
risks (for example, changes in the value of the assets and
liabilities) are then transferred to the buyer. That's why, he says,
Enron's cash flow will be up dramatically, while debt will be ""way
down, way down"" when the company publishes its full year-end results,
which are due out soon.

   That's good, because Enron will need plenty of cash to fund its
new, high-cost initiatives: namely, the high-cost buildout of its
broadband operations. In order to facilitate its plan to trade excess
bandwidth capacity, Enron is constructing its own network. This
requires big capital expenditures. So broadband had better be a good
business. Both Enron and some of the analysts who cover it think it
already is. Included in the $126 a share that Enron says it's worth
is $40 a share--or $35 billion--for broadband. Several of Enron's
analysts value broadband at $25 a share, or roughly $22 billion (and
congratulate themselves for being conservative). But $22 billion
seems like a high valuation for a business that reported $408 million
of revenues and $60 million of losses in 2000. Not all analysts are
so aggressive. ""Valuing the broadband business is an ""extremely
difficult, uncertain exercise at this point in time,"" notes Bear
Stearns' Winters, who thinks that broadband, while promising, is
worth some $5 a share today.

   Of course everything could go swimmingly. Enron has told analysts
that it plans to sell between $2 billion and $4 billion of assets
over the next 12 months. The bullish scenario for Enron is that the
proceeds from those sales will reduce debt, and as earnings from new
businesses kick in, the company's return on invested capital will
shoot upward. Along with broadband, Enron has ambitious plans to
create big businesses trading a huge number of other commodities,
from pulp and paper to data storage to advertising time and space.
Perhaps most promising is its Enron Energy Services business, which
manages all the energy needs of big commercial and industrial
companies. Skilling has told analysts that its new businesses will
generate a return on invested capital of about 25% over the long run.

   But all of these expectations are based on what Wolfe, the  J.P.
Morgan strategist, calls ""a little bit of the China syndrome""--in
other words, if you get x% of y enormous market, you'll get z in
revenues. For instance, Enron says the global market for broadband
and storage services will expand from $155 billion in 2001 to
somewhere around $383 billion in 2004. ""Even a modest market share
and thin margins provide excellent potential here,"" writes Ed
Tirello, a Deutsche Bank Alex. Brown senior power strategist. The
problem, as we know from innumerable failed dot-coms, is that the y
enormous market doesn't always materialize on schedule. And Enron
isn't leaving itself a lot of room for the normal wobbles and
glitches that happen in any developing business.

   In the end, it boils down to a question of faith. ""Enron is no
black box,"" says Goldman's Fleischer. ""That's like calling Michael
Jordan a black box just because you don't know what he's going to
score every quarter."" Then again, Jordan never had to promise to hit
a certain number of shots in order to please investors.

How do we get the right focus on support for Calgary?  Mark Taylor wanted to 
hold up transferring confirm responsibility to Calgary, so we still need to 
provide excellent service to them.  While I can appreciate that Diane is out, 
that should actually be a red flag to us to pay even closer attention to the 
Calgary stuff.  Every screw up looks big to them, and they can't understand 
how mistakes continue to happen.  While I know that they can't appreciate the 
vast number of transactions that the group is currently handling, we still 
need to be able to deliver top notch service.  Unfortunately, we stub our toe 
enough with Calgary that they view of our operation is one that delivers 
pretty poor to average service.  That is a terrible internal PR issue.  Let's 
put our heads together on not just the confirm issue but all of our dealings 
with Calgary so that we quickly turn around our error rate (and/or their 
perceptions) and  can sustain excellent service. I am copying Susan because 
she has dealt recently with an issue brought to our attention by  Rob 
Milnthorp (president of Enron Canada).  She responded to Rob quickly and 
handled things professionally, so she may not have shared the details with 
you at the time.  But now we need to look at all of our outstanding, 
potential or past issues with Calgary and get a solution in place.  She can 
fill you in on the details in that situation.  

Susan:  Do you have any ideas on how we can reshape our image with Calgary?

Just so that you are aware, we continue to have problems with the financial 
confirm process from Houston.  On more than one occasion, confirmations have 
been sent to our counterparties prior to review by Calgary.  Attached is the 
most recent one.   We have been assured over and over that this will not 
happen again, however, it continues to happen.  Luckily, this confirmation 
went out without any errors in it.  I know that you are very busy, but  is 
there any way that you can make it a priority to get resolution on moving the 
financial confirmations to Calgary.

Peggy,

As far as I can tell, we simply screwed up on this deal.  Diane Anderson, who 
was covering for Angie last week, was using my name to sign off on some other 
Canada deals which were approved from last week then signed and sent this one 
by mistake.  We're terribly sorry for the mistake.  Call me if you want to 
discuss.

Since Dianne Seib is currently on vacation, I am reviewing the financial

to Counterparty"", although our records show that we have not yet approved the 
revised confirm.  Can you check on this for me and let me know whether this 
was sent prior to receiving Calgary's approval?  If you have any questions, I 
can be contacted at ext. 6753.

Kate,  

A request (below) has been made to fix a deal that was entered by Tom and 
Mark incorrectly (through the option exercise function in deal blotter).  The 
deal numbers and legs that need to be fixed are listed below.  Instead of 
being a forward transaction, these legs should be entered as index forwards.  
We are paying the DJ PV index plus $5 or 5%, whichever is more.  Therefore, 
if daily prices were more than $100 at palo verde, the offset should be 1.05.

I know that i have totally confused you but let me know of any questions you 
might have and I will be glad to help.

Thanks,

Kim

Julie,

I don't know if I told you before, but I'm leaving tomorrow for a long weekend in the Caymans with my new group.  I can't tell you how much my life has changed in the last three weeks.  I'm getting out of the office no later than 6:30 everyday (and it's usually closer to 4:30-5:00) and I actually have time to do other things with my life.  I went to the symphony last week, am going to a reception at the MFA next week, joined a volunteer organization geared toward young professionals and am thinking about joining the church I've been going to the last couple of months.  All in all life has improved.  Still nothing new on the guy front, but I'm in no rush so it's not that big a deal.

I am so excited about my trip out to San Diego to see you.  I promise to be well rested and ready to shop, eat and go out....or just sit on the beach.  Like I said before, I'm up for anything.  

Hope things are going well with you, the job and Brendan.  Drop me a line if you get a chance and let me know what's new in your life.

Talk to you soon,
Susan  ",medium,medium,

Hey Sherry,

Here is the spreadsheet with the Duke Energy Marketing deals that I need you 
to flip to the FT-US/CAND-ERMS book as soon as possible.  I need to get an 
invoice to them within the next few hours as they need to settle with us on 
Monday.



If you could go through your book and flip any deals between ENA and Duke 
Energy Marketing LP to the P& book to settle with ECC that would help solve 
some problems.  Please let me know if you have any questions on this.  Just 
to let you know, Carole Frank took notes this morning when I walked her 
through running that download in TAGG.  It can be done for any counterparty 
in any book, so you can also run it for Duke Energy Marketing LP as well.

Thanks

Gabriel,

I'm not sure if Binh sent an email to you and to Controls to explain the 
Canadian origination variance.  You may already be aware, but on the Orig 
Sched the originations are converted to $US using the spot rate for the day.  
However when the originations are calculated for the Report tab the rate 
applied is the average rate for the month.  Therefore these values will never 
be the same.  Nicole is going to talk to Kathy when she gets back to Canada 
on Monday.  Nicole says she has found a way to modify their spreadsheet so 
that both values are calculated using the daily spot rate.   If you haven't 
recieved an email from Binh explaining this issue you might want to forward 
the attached message from Nicole to Michael and Chris.  

Thanks,
Robin

PS The Bench by trader tied out for the 23rd.  I'll be in a little early

Subject: Origination Problem

Robin,
I spoke with Kathy regarding the problem we are having with origination. Her 
explanation is as follows:
This is an fx issue. Because origination is denominated in a currency (USD) 
which is different than our functional currency (CAD), origination expense 
will be comprised of not only origination but also currency gains and losses 
on origination. Everyday orig. is retranslated in C$ using the current rate 
and any fx gains or losses relating to that is added to origination.  
Therefore, the total origination as per the ""origination"" tab will NOT equal 
the origination as per the ""report"" tab. Robin should add in the translation 
gains/losses to get it to reconcile. 
I hope this explanation makes sense and is acceptable. I know you're used to 
the two numbers reconciling but since we were asked to denominate our 
origination in US dollars (about 2 months ago) these two numbers will never 
again be the same.
Please call if you have any questions,
Nicole ",low,low,

Vince,

I am in Houston (rrived Satruday), and will be in office on Monday (though 
officially, I am on vacation).  Would like to catch up with you if possible.

It looks like your team will be getting involved in some form on the DPC 
side.  I have already made a recommendation to Wade.

I am attaching a small memo that I have addressed to Wade on the DPC position 
and possible workout.  This is still a draft and will likely get shared later 
with others.  I would love to get your comments on the same.  At the same 
time, this also will give you some idea of the problem, in conjunction with 
the other Plan presentation I had sent you.

Look forward to touching base with you.

Regards,
Sandeep.",low,high,medium

I am so sorry I slacked on this - I guess I didn't see you around the office 
and it just got bumped off the mental ""list of things to do."" Don't worry - 
I've transfered it to a hard copy list now. Enjoy!

concern especially here in Houston
because of the world wide participation in
the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo.

Please foward this simple yet effective

Subject:  Sagewood Phase II


George,

Thank you for the opportunity to review your financing request for the 
Sagewood
Phase II project.  Upon receipt of all the requested information regarding the
project, we completed somewhat of a due diligence on the market.  There are a
number of concerns which need to be addressed prior to the Bank moving forward
on the transaction.  First, the pro-forma rental rates, when compared on a
Bedroom to Bedroom basis, are high relative to the market.   We adjusted
pro-forma downward to match the market rates and the rates per bedroom we are
acheiving on the existing Sagewood project.  Additionally, there are about 
500+
units coming on-line within the next 12 months in the City of San Marcos, 
this,
we believe will causes some downward rent pressures which can have a serious
effect on an over leveraged project.  We have therefore adjusted the requested
loan amount to $8,868,000.

I have summarized our issues as follows:

1.  Pro-forma rental rates were adjusted downward to market as follows:

     Pro-Forma                           Bank's Adjustment
     Unit           Unit Rent Rent/BR    Unit Rent      Rent/BR
     2 BR/2.5 BA         $1,150          $575           $950           $475
     3 BR/Unit      $1,530         $510       $1,250         $417

2.  Pro-forma expenses were increased to include a $350/unit reserve for unit
turn over.

3.  A market vacancy factor of 5% was applied to Potential Gross Income (PGI).

4.  Based on the Bank's revised N.O.I. of $1,075,000, the project can support
debt in the amount of $8,868,000, and maintain our loan parameters of 1.25x 
debt
coverage ratio, on a 25 year amo., and 8.60% phantom interest rate.

5.  The debt service will be approx. $874,000/year.

6.  Given the debt of $8,868,000, the Borrower will be required to provide
equity of $2,956,000, consisting of the following:

     Land -                   $1,121,670
     Deferred profit& Overhead     $    415,000
     Cash Equity              $1,419,268
     Total                    $2,955,938

7. Equity credit for deferred profit and overhead was limited to a percentage 
of
actual hard construction costs.

Steve filled in the detail for me on the LG&E issue mentioned in the Law 
bullets this morning.  A valve was left open between an LG&E facility and 
Northern for an approximate 3 month period (I'm not sure how recent).  LG&E's 
gas loss data indicates that the amount of gas that inadvertently got into 
Northern was approx. 180,000 MMBtu, with a value of about $500,000.   Rockey 
and Steve have talked to LG&E and it does not appear that we have any good 
arguments for avoiding the liability.  The unexpected (and unmetered) 
deliveries from LG&E presumably reduced our lost and unaccounted for balance 
during the referenced 3 month period.  Accordingly, I assume the cost of 
replacing that gas should be accounted for in Northern's PRA and so should 
not affect earnings.   I'm not sure what the timetable is for resolving this 
matter.  DF  ",medium,low,medium

Ontario Power Generation and Bruce Power announce leasing agreement at Bruce 
Nuclear 

    KINCARDINE, ON, July 11 /CNW-PRN/ - Ontario Power Generation (OPG) today
announced it has entered into a major agreement with Bruce Power Partnership
relating to the facilities at the Bruce nuclear site. Bruce Power is 95% owned
by British Energy plc. The transaction provides an opportunity for the two
main unions, the Power Workers' Union and The Society of Energy Professionals
on the Bruce site, to subscribe to 5% of the equity.
    This public/private partnership involves a long-term lease agreement for
the Bruce A (3076 MW-currently in lay-up), and Bruce B (3140 MW) facilities.
The lease runs until 2018, with an option to extend for up to another 25
years. OPG will receive an initial payment of $625 M to be made in three
installments. A first payment of $400 M will be made on closing subject to
normal closing adjustments. The remaining $225 M will be paid in two
installments of $112.5 M each.
    Bruce Power's annual payments include base and variable elements. The
variable elements include a share of the net revenue, and supplementary
payments for the management of used fuel. In total these payments are
estimated to be about $150 M in calendar year 2002.
    Bruce Power will offer employment to all employees at the Bruce site,
other than those being retained by OPG. Employees remaining with OPG include
those that provide waste management and centralized nuclear operations support
services. The agreement is expected to close, subject to Bruce Power obtaining
the necessary licences, in the summer of 2001.
    ""Today's announcement is good news for employees, the community, the
electricity consumer and the shareholder"" stated Ron Osborne, OPG President
and CEO. ""This agreement injects private equity into the Bruce facilities
which in turn will provide new opportunities for employees and the community.
It is also a major step towards opening the Ontario electricity marketplace to
competition and providing electricity consumers with choice."" Osborne noted
that an additional benefit of the agreement allows OPG to concentrate on
accelerating the performance improvements underway at its Darlington and
Pickering nuclear facilities while the new company focuses on the Bruce.
    Nuclear safety continues to be of paramount importance for Ontario Power
Generation, and safety has been a key tenet for British Energy. Both companies
are committed to ensuring high safety performance standards.
    ""We are delighted to be announcing the creation of a new company. Bruce
Power will demonstrate that safety and commercial success go hand in hand,""
said Robin Jeffrey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of British Energy
Canada Ltd. ""We have a high regard for CANDU technology and for the skill of
the staff at Bruce. We are confident that by working with the staff and the
unions, Bruce Power can achieve world class safety and commercial
performance.""
    To reduce its market dominance, OPG is required by conditions in its
operating licence granted by the Ontario Energy Board (OEB), to reduce its
share of generating capacity to no more than 35 per cent of that available to
the province 10 years after the market opens.
    British Energy was selected following an extensive worldwide competitive
process over the last two years. They have significant operating experience
and a proven safety track record with a range of nuclear reactor types.
    To close the transaction, Bruce Power will be required to secure licences
from the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission (CNSC) and the Ontario Energy
Board. Bruce Power will be required to follow the stringent licensing and
operating requirements established by CNSC, formerly the Atomic Energy Control
Board.
    Ontario Power Generation is a major North American electricity generating
company. OPG's principal business is the generation and sale of electricity to
consumers in Ontario and into the interconnected markets. OPG's goal is to be
a premier North American energy company, focused on low-cost power generation
and wholesale energy sales, while operating in a safe, open and
environmentally responsible manner.
    British Energy PLC is the UK's largest electricity generator. British
Energy owns and operates 15 reactors in the UK and a further two in the United
States through its joint venture, AmerGen. British Energy's goal is to be a
worldwide electricity leader building on its ""Safety First"" culture and track
record of commercial success.

	FuelCell Energy Announces Two Contract Awards
Thursday, November 2, 2000 07:07 AM	?Mail this article to a friend 
	DANBURY, Conn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Nov. 2, 2000-- 
	New, Specialized Applications for Direct FuelCell(TM) Power Plants 
	FuelCell Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ: FCEL, news, msgs) announced the award of 
contracts for two new power plants using the company's Direct FuelCells(R) 
(DFC(R)) for coal mine and remote location applications. The first contract 
is for a $5.4 million project with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) 
National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL) for the design, construction and 
operation of a 250 kW DFC, utilizing coal mine methane gas, at the Harrison 
Mining Corporation coal mine in Cadiz, Ohio. The second contract, for 
$100,000, is from the U.S. Coast Guard Research and Development Center in 
Groton, Connecticut for a remote location, 3 kW fuel cell power system, using 
methanol for fuel. It is scheduled to be installed during the second quarter 
of 2001 at the Cape Henry Lighthouse at Fort Story, near Virginia Beach, VA. 
	Coal Mine Methane: Cost-Free Fuel Reduces Emissions 
	FuelCell Energy was selected for the coal mine methane emission reduction 
project to demonstrate the ability of the DFC to generate electricity, using 
coal mine methane emissions that otherwise escape into the atmosphere. Costs 
for the three-year program will be shared equally by the DOE and FuelCell 
Energy. As a result, in addition to the environmental benefits of reducing 
emissions, the cost of electricity produced from coal mine methane is reduced 
by using a fuel that is essentially free. 
	""The DOE has been supporting the development of fuel cells for more than two 
decades,"" said Mark C. Williams, fuel cell product manager for NETL. ""This 
application to coal mine methane effectively combines efficient power 
generation with a solution to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions."" 
	According to FuelCell Energy, 75% of the world's coal mine methane emissions 
from active and abandoned coal mines comes from the top six countries with 
coal mining operations. A total of approximately 1,000 megawatts of fuel cell 
power could be generated using coal mine methane from the two sources. The 
U.S., alone, has approximately 300 megawatts of unutilized coal mine methane 
capacity. At an estimated $1,000 kW, the 1,000 MW worldwide potential for 
FuelCell Energy fuel cell power plants is equivalent to a $1.0 billion 
market. 
	""The use of coal mine methane to power Direct FuelCells will result in 
benefits for all concerned,"" said Jerry D. Leitman, president and CEO of 
FuelCell Energy. ""Coal mine methane is a greenhouse gas which can be 
remediated. By using it to fuel a DFC power plant, a customer turns a 
liability into an asset that gets rid of a polluting gas and produces 
electric power in an environmentally responsible fashion. An important 
milestone for the company is to identify prospective early-adopter markets. 
The coal mine methane market provides a virtually free fuel source to operate 
the fuel cells, facilitating early adoption by energy users."" 
	Remote Power: Clean Energy Where the Wires End 
	The U.S. Coast Guard Research and Development Center has awarded FuelCell 
Energy a $100,000 contract to provide a 3 kW DFC power plant at the Cape 
Henry Lighthouse, for a field test at the lighthouse to demonstrate fuel cell 
capabilities at remote sites. The Coast Guard operates several hundred 
unattended power systems at remote site communication stations, radio 
navigation stations, weather stations, and aids to navigation such as 
lighthouses, structures, and buoys. Stand alone fuel cell power systems offer 
efficiency and environmental advantages for remote site operation. The 
methanol fuel allows for simpler, more compact process equipment for FuelCell 
Energy's Direct FuelCell plant compared to other fuel sources. 
	""This demonstration project by FuelCell Energy is the first application of 
fuel cells at a remote, unmanned site in a marine environment"", said Walt 
Lincoln, project manager of the U.S. Coast Guard Research and Development 
Center. ""We're interested in the potential of the fuel cell because of its 
promise of reduced maintenance and greater reliability compared to other 
systems."" 
	""In addition to the unattended applications for the Coast Guard, there are 
other potential remote power applications in operation around the world, such 
as pipeline monitoring, microwave relay stations, and numerous other 
communications and recreational uses that could be served by fuel cells,"" 
said Leitman. 
	Using carbonate fuel cell technology, the DFC(R) power plant produces high 
efficiency energy through an electro-chemical reaction, rather than through 
combustion. This method of producing power gives energy users the option of 
producing electricity on site with the assurance of lower emissions, less 
noise and with shorter timeframes required for the permitting process. 
	About FuelCell Energy, Inc. 
	FuelCell Energy, Inc. - www.fce.com - formerly Energy Research Corp., is a 
leading developer of carbonate fuel cell technology for stationary power 
generation. The Company's Direct FuelCell technology eliminates external fuel 
processing to extract hydrogen from a hydrocarbon fuel. This results in a 
product whose cost, combined with high efficiency, simplicity and 
reliability, results in product advantages for stationary power generation. 
FuelCell Energy, based in Danbury, CT is developing Direct FuelCell(R) power 
plants with nominal ratings of 300 kW, 1.5 MW and 3 MW.. The Company has been 
developing DFC(R) technology for stationary power plants with the U.S. 
Department of Energy through the National Energy Technology Laboratory 
(NETL). The NETL's advanced fuel cell research program is focused on 
developing a new generation of high performance fuel cells that can generate

Subject: FW: Amended Index Graph


Michael

I have got CSFB working on the amendment you asked for.

In the meantime we have produced a graph which shows, as indices, market 
values of the water companies and the RAB of the industry since 
privatisation.  The following points come out
1 Market values overtime have been 1.1x RAB
2 The result is significantly skewed by the period between Mid 1997 and end 
1998 when the ratio was c1.5x.
3 The premium to RAB is only found at a time when political uncertainty has 
been removed the companies are able to outperform the regulatory deal 
significantly.  Those days are gone - a fact witnessed by the decline in 
share prices in the last year

Just to note that the graph we have produced here is a weighted average of 
water companies - whereas the figures we did yesterday on the RAB market 
value ratio is a straight average.  Obviously that influences the numbers a 
little.

On CustomerCo.  CSFB have contacted around 7 energy companies.  The result 
has been positive and they are prepared to enter our journal exercise.  I 
await a revised fee proposal but CSFB have been advised that it should be 
more modest than the last one !

I can certainly send you this file each day - I hope it can be of some help. 
All the deals it lists are with EPMI Short Term California, which is myself 
or Jeff Richter; so I'm not sure how helpful it will be in determining which 
desk or counterparty you have discrepancies with. While we're on the subject 
of sharing files, though, I had spoken with the confirmation group in Houston 
about the deal file you send them each day. They suggested I ask to be added 
to the list so I can better assist their group in finding discrepancies in 
EPMI-EES deals. If that's okay with you, I would appreciate receiving it.

In the meantime, I'll copy you on the EES sale prices starting tomorrow.

Thanks,
Kate

Kate,
I am in the confirmation group with EES and try to tie out our confirmtions 
with the EPMI list I receive from Kim Hundle (EPMI), on a weekly basis.  This 
file would be great help with this process.  Is there any way you could send 
this to me as well? This would help me determine who the problem is with.  I 
would appreciate it.

Ok- since you finally asked-

It is this book entitled ""The Story of a Lifetime- A Keepsake of Personal 
Memoirs"".  

Here is the description that was given:

""Give this book to someone whose story you want to know . . . It invites the 
reader to share memories, facts, philosophies, beliefs, knowledge, and wisdom 
gained from a lifetime of experience.  Hundreds of questions encourage 
thoughtful reponses.  When complete, it's a priceless heirloom for future 
generations.""

I thought it was a neat gift idea- so that your mom can share her thoughts 
with you, and you (your children, your children's children) would have them 
when (unfortunately) she is not around anymore.

I ordered one for my mom also.

Hopefully it will be as neat as it sounds.

Dear Rick,

You might remember me; we met in September when you visited Metgas in Mumbai 
with the LNG team. At the time I presented a piece on the MetGas equity sale 
and opportunities of cooperation with the Indian Oil Company.

Following Sanjay's new role in the organisation, he has now charged me with 
developing the EBS business in the Middle East. In this regard I had a 
telecon with Mac McClelland yesterday, the details of which are copied in the 
mail below. 

I would like to visit Dubai possibly next week to see the Dubai Internet 
City, meet with senior officials at the Internet and Media cities to identify 
what opportunities there could be for EBS.

We look forward to closely cooperating with you and your team in Dubai.

With best regards,   Anil

Mac,

You would be aware that Sanjay Bhatnagar has been given the responsibility of 
managing EBS business in the Middle East and Asia and our team reports 
directly to him. We are currently wanting to develop an EBS strategy for the 
Middle East. For this objective Amr Ibrahim (Director, Regulatory) and myself 
would like to plan a visit to Dubai in the near future (possibly early next 
week). We would like to have a half hour conference call with you today to 
discuss this visit. Based on your exposure and presence in Dubai, we would 
like to seek advise from you on the below, which would be the objective of 
our trip;

Dubai Internet City. We are well aware of this tremendous infrastructure that 
has been developed in Dubai. Our information is based on what was available 
on the web. We would like to see this facility, meet with the relevant people 
in the Communications group and establish what business opportunities could 
be available for EBS. From our understanding, the DIC infrastructure has 
being developed by Siemens, Sun and Cisco. Fibre connectivity is provided by 
a local telecom party. 
Business potential. We would be developing a business plan for the Middle 
East region and would like to identify what support we could get from Enron's 
immendate presence in the region, in the way of direction.
Immediate business opportunity. What are the low hanging fruit for EBS in the 
Middle East region and what are the first areas we should focus on that would 
give us success, to quickly neutralize cost.
How do we get multiple entry visas for Dubai. Is it possible to get a one (or 
three) month visa. Can we them for coming Sunday or would it be a rush? We 
have Canadian and Danish passports.

I will call you at 12 noon (Dubai time) this morning. 


With best regards,   Anil

I need to finish up an agreement and have it sent to a man by the name of 
John ""Steinbow"". Please call him and get the correct spelling of his name, 
his address and his fax number.  If he (or his assistant) needs an 
explanation, I need the info to complete an agreement requested by Mark 
Bernstein.  (Mark doesn't have the info, but doesn't want John to know he 
doesn't have it, so please don't call Mark to ask.)

Steinbow's number is 914 697 2418.

John,

This is a follow-up to our earlier discussion.  I would like to have you lay 
out our physical crude needs to become a player a long with some action steps 
to accomplish the goal.  I don't want to forget about this because I believe 
it may be something we need to assign someone or a mid-market or originator 
or team to accomplish.  I would like to see foreign and domestic.  
I see this as one of our possible competitive advantages or at least to solve 
the problem of not being in the know and getting second hand info or 
pricing.  

Thanks,

Subject: CA Energy Development


Kay:

George Kutzschbach of Fulbright called this afternoon to request copies of
the executed Assignment and Assumption Agreements and Bills of Sale for the
turbine/transformer transaction between ENA and Sweetgum Energy LP.  George
has unsigned copies of these documents.  Our closing volumes also contain
only unsigned copies of these documents.   

George is asking for the documents with respect to both the turbines and the
transformer, but is needing them specifically for the transformer.
Apparently, CA-II is planning to sell the transformer, and he is gathering
up the documents that would show title to the transformer in CA-II.  

I have reviewed the documents, and do not see any reason why we should not
deliver them.  Can you provide signed copies of these documents?   Thanks.

Hi Manny & Jack,

Attached is our draft Master Purchase/Sale Agreement for physical natural gas transactions.  Once we get the ISDA signed and executed we can start on this contract.  It would be good to go ahead and get it in place so that when/if we want to do a physical deal, we won't have to worry about paper.

Did we get you everything that you need to go forward with the ISDA?

I will talk to you next week.  Have a good weekend.

Thanks,

Kevin,

How are things going?  Don't imagine you are too upset not having to deal 
with California or the wildfires out west?  Things are going well for us 
here, but as we expected it is like the US in 94/95 (things just starting) 
and Europe (96/97).  The Japanese utilities are not being too original in 
their approach... same playbook.  Regardless of all of this, looking at sites 
and potential development of physical trading assets is starting to look 
quite promising.  Jpnese cutting back on nuclear and significantly increasing 
LNG and many old oil-fired plants out there are just a few of the 
characteristics.

You mentioned in your last email that you had significantly reduced your 
efforts at adding capacity in the East.  Along these lines would you know of 
anyone that might be interested in a Japan tour to get all of this going?  
Ideally it would be someone at the Director level.  Let me know.

My  trading operations team, under the leadership of Mary Solmonson, is 
sponsoring a working session on Thursday and Friday, June 15 and 16 in the 
ballroom at the Rice.   Mary leads the team that manages Global Databases, 
our global contract, counterparty and facilities databases that create the 
common platform that facilitates the consolidation of information for credit 
aggregation, risk exposure, customer information, feeds to SAP for financial 
reporting, etc.    In addition to managing these databases, Mary has 
harnessed information from these databases in a new way to create an 
effective prospecting tool for use by originators and traders.  This tool can 
help measure and increase coverage by industry segments.  This project,  
Entelligence, has been endorsed by Greg Whalley and Jeff Shankman and is 
currently under development for delivery later this quarter.  

We invite you to speak to the group of Enron employees from offices worldwide 
who will attend the working session next week.  Please let me know if you are 
interested and if June 15 or June 16 fits your schedule.  

Thanks for considering this speaking opportunity.  ",medium,high,high

Looks nice.  I just had my meeting with my V.P.- looks like I will be doing 
my next rotation through EES tax (starts Aug 15th).  I hear it is a real good 
group to work with (real smart and nice people)- but I think they put in a 
lot of overtime- especially during federal compliance and some during state 
compliance time.  Anyway- state compliance is in September and October- so 
going before I rotate in August  might not be a bad idea- although I really 
think they would let me take vacation whatever time I asked for.  Side 
thought- when in the hell am I going to study for the CPA- especially since I 
have NO motivation and I am about to enter a group that has lots of OT.  You 
do realize that I am never going to pass that exam- and I'll probably lose my 
job- and then either you or my family will just have to take care of me.  I 
am feeling a little stressed/anxious today for some reason- in case you 
didn't pick up on that.  I definately feel like I need a vacation.

Subject: PSEG Request

Kay:

I talked with PSEG this morning.  PSEG would like to negotiate and sign a 
binding LOI regarding the Kendall project site in Illinois prior to 
negotiating and executing the Definitive SPA.  The specifics of this LOI are:

 PSEG would pay an up-front $300,000 payment to ENA 
 This payment would be non-refundable unless PSEG discovered a ""fatal flaw"" 
in the project (we will have to carefully define this concept)
 The binding LOI would establish a date by which the SPA would be executed or 
PSEG would forfeit the up-front payment
 The $2.7 MM balance of the Purchase Price would be due upon closing (signing 
the SPA and transferring the member interests).

I believe that PSEG is getting nervous that we may close on the Kendall LLC 
with another Buyer before they get their act together.

Call me to discuss the timing of drafting such an LOI.  I would like to 
strike on PSEG while they are anxious and motivated.  My goal is to send the 
LOI to PSEG by Wednesday of this week.  I can work directly with Carolyn if 
that is the most efficient approach.

This email has the prices in Exhibit N of the current draft agreement.  Are 
these the correct numbers?

Kathy and I discussed your comments, and she is making changes to the 
contract consistent with those comments.  She is not available this 
afternoon, but is free tomorrow am to discuss the contract. Please let me 
know if tomorrow am works for you.

We do not have deal to enter for this.  You need to look at the entire Midtex 
line for each of the days that are out of balance.  If we are short at Katy, 
I would think that we would be long at Dewville.  (Many times, our receipts 
from the Midtex line at Katy are offset by our deliveries to Tufco at the 
Tap.)  This should help you fix the January problem.  Also, for December, you 
may need to ask PG&E where they show the delivery for Western.  Is it at HPL 
Katy, as our records show, or is it at PGE's another point on the Midtex 
line?  In any case, we don't have deliveries to make.  The only other remedy 
is to book the variance on the partnership imbalance.

Daren - can you set up a delivery deal for meter 8740 for Jan 00 and Dec. 
99?   I checked OSS and there is an 089 operational contract that took the 
swing in case the meter flows more or less than the nom.   Third party 
contracts are supposed to stay whole.  Days 12-14 did not flow enough to 
cover the noms for Western.  We have the same problem on Jan. 25.  Please let 
me know, Brenda Herod would like this resolved today, as would I.

Stacy- Can you please set up a new deal for meter 8740 for Dec. 99.  The 
problem with this meter is,  all third party transports should stay whole and 
HPL takes the swing.  Several days the meter did not flow enough and the 
third parties did not receive all of their gas.  I need a delivery set up so 
the 3rd parties will stay whole.  If you have any questions, please let me 
know.

Aimee,

 We are still having problem with this meter.  From what I understand of our 
conversation a week or two ago, HPL needs to take the swing to keep the other 
contracts whole.  In the case where we have excess flow the HPL (R) contract 
takes the swing.  So in the case where we are short, shouldn't we have a HPL 
(D) contract to take the swing?  Please let me know if this will work.  I 
need to get back with Settlement today.  Thanks

To make a long story short.

Williams is long 4000MW of tolling in SP15 (SoCal )  for 20 years (I know I 
did the deal)
on Tuesday afternoon, Williams sold 1000 MW to Merrill Lynch for the 
remaining life (now 18 years)

Merrill is short fixed price gas at So Cal border  up to 250,000MMBtu a day 
and long SP15 power (1000 MW) a day.

heat rate 10,500  SoCal Border plus $0.50.

I'm not sure if MRL has just brokered this deal or is warehousing it.

For what its worth........

Mike Swerzbin did not get a confirm from the broker on these deals. They were 
two sleeves done with EES, and Driscoll just entered them. Thanks for the 
heads up. Any other questions, just give me a call or e-mail.

Diana says Amerex told her both deals were on the same ticket - so she 
entered deal 577201at 50 mw. I asked her to get ahold of her contact at 
Amerex to tell them they're checking out incorrectly.

I see several sales to Puget in Diana's blotter at a $375 price, only one 
with Amerex, and it's for 50 MW. I'll need to get ahold of her in the morning 
to verify the brokers on these. I'll let you know as soon as I do.

John,

Terrell Benke was a summer Associate from the University of Chicago who has 
just accepted Enron's full-time employment offer.  Erik, her husband, 
currently works at Goldman Sachs as a junior trader in Chicago.  Therefore, 
since Terrell will be moving to Houston, Erik is very interested in pursuing 
potential trading opportunities at Enron.

Please look at his resume and inform me if you have any interest in his 
background.

_______________________________________________________________

Here are my comments re Peoples' mark-up:
                                         1. Sects. 1.1, 1.11, 10.2, and
15.1(f). The combined effect of the proposed changes to these sections is
to significantly broaden the terminantion right in the event that
governmental action related to the agreement is modified in a manner
unacceptable to either party. As changed the unacceptable approval can come
at any time during the term of the agreement, and need not  involve
approval  ""required"" for the agreement to remain effective. Peoples did not
propose to include language from the comparable NIGAS Hub Agreement which
refers to adverse ""rate approval"". However, Peoples' intent may be to
obtain a termination remedy in the event of an adverse rate-making decision
re the treatment of Hub revenues. In any event, the meaning of a
termination right triggered if a government approval (not necessarily
required for the agreement to remain in effect) is modified ""in any manner
which is unacceptable"" is, at best, unclear. We should try to stay with the
original language (or, perhaps, limit expansion of the termination right to
circumstances when a ""required"" approval is revoked.) While the broadened
termination right proposed by Peoples is available to either party, I
wouldn't think it likely that MEH would wish to terminate as a result of a
modified regualtory decision not required for continuation of the agency
arrangement.
2. Sects. 1.6, 7.1. 2.2, 2.10 (comments re cumulative net revenue
definition) As modified, MEH is charged with the duty to market Hub
Serivces, which includes Extended Hub Serivces (Def'n. 1.17). However, the
proposed Adminisatrative Service Fee (7.1) is only payable during the term
of the Agreement. MEH, therefore, is required by the Agreement to market
extended Hub Services, but receives no compensation (after termination of
the Agreement) for doing so. Also, Peoples proposes to add provision (C)
eliminating refund amounts from the definition of Cumulative Net Revenue.
Apparently in conjuction with this, Peoples proposes to delete the last
sentence of 1.6 which requires a retroactive adjustment of cumulative net
revenue in the event of a refund. Peoples also has bracketed 7.3,
apparently intending to exclude it. I suppose this is fine from MEH's
perspective. The effect of these changes is to deduct only amounts actually
refunded from the revenue base for the administrative fee, and not require
a retroactive adjustment. This could benefit MEH if the agreement
terminates before a refund is required. No retroactive adjustment would be
needed.
3. Sect. 1.9, 2.5. Peoples proposes to delete the requirement that it make
nominating or scheduling changes on interstate pipelines for receipt or
delivery of gas needed for hub transactions or delivery of gas at a
secondary point for displacement delivery. Northern Illinois Gas Co. did
agree to these provision in the contract with its Hub Agent. I do not know
the value of these commitments to MEH from a business standpoint.
                         4. Sect. 1.13. Peoples proposes that the GTC be
defined to included changes made by Peoples in its sole discretion.
Peoples, however, is not free to change the GTC as it sees fit. FERC may
elect to allow changes proposed by Peoples to become effective, but Peoples
can, at most, ""propose"" changes in its sole discretion. How about: ""the
effective general Terms and Conditions of the Operating Statament as may be
modified from time to time."" Sect. 6.1 gives Peoples a right to propose
changes to the GTC, so there is no need to cover that here.
                              5. Sect. 1.17. The GTC does not indicate that
Parking and Loaning Service must be interruptible. I will review this
further.                      6. Sect. 2.2. Peoples has modified the
language giving it responsibility to ensure compliance with the GTC to
assign this obligation to both parties. The intent was to comply with
requirements of FERC orders indicating that an agent need not be
certificated as a ""natural gas company"", if there is another entity with
clear responponsibilty to ensure compliance with the Natural Gas Act and
FERC regulations. I suggest we stay with the origianl language indicating
that Peoples, the certificate holder, has the responsibility to ensure
compliance with regulatory requirements.
          7. Sect. 2.4b The thrid sentence is confusing in light of the
sending sentence indicating that MEH must consent to a change in
information re firm capacity. Perhaps ""in its sole discretion"" can be
delted and the last word of the third sentence changed to ""appropriate"".
                              8. Sect. 2.5. New Item 3 of the list of
grounds for refusal should be deleted. The GTC (Sect. 8.2) specifies the
grounds on which Hub Serivce can be denied. The Agency Agreement should not
add to this. Also, the GTC expressly requires that firm serivce provided
under the Operating Statement and firm serivce under peoples' Illiniois
tariffs have equal scheduling priority.
                                   9. Sect. 2.10. This Section places the
risk of non-payment on MEH, unless Peoples conducts the credit check. This
is how risk was allocated in the NIGAS Hub Agreement. That agreement,
however, provided for a 50/50 split of Hub revenue. As proposed by Peoples,
MEH would receive only an agency fee and lesser percentage of revenue. With
the changed allocation of revenue, a changed allocation of non-payment risk
also may be appropriate. Normally, the this risk should follow
responsibility for accepting the transaction. At a minimum, non-payment
risk should be assigned to Peoples if (i) it performs the credit check; or
(ii) requires MEH to accept a Hub customer which MEH has rejected based on
a credit analysis conducted under the GTC (Sect. 8.2).
     10. Sect. 3.3. The required refunds could be large relative to the
administrative fee. The revised language requires MEH to finance refunds
for ten business days. Should there be an interest component?
                                                        11. Sect. 3.4. This
Section suggests that MEH will receive a fee for Extended Hub Services. I'm
don't see how this occurs under the revised language.   12. Sect. 3.5.
Peoples proposes to delete the language requiring best efforts to minimize
imbalances. Compliance filings due this summer under FERC Order 637 are
expected to offer incentives related to avoidance of imbalances and Peoples
should attempt to use these procedures. We should discuss this with them on
Wed.
                    13. Sect. 5.1. Peoples has modified the warranties to
indicate consistency of the Agency Agreement with ""material"" contractcs and
Judgments or Laws not expected to have a material adverse effect. Is it
suffucuent to have minor contract violations and inconsistency with some
Laws/Judgments?               14. Sect. 7.1 The NIGAS Hub Agreement did not
have a flat fee component.
15. Sect. 10.1. Because the Governmental Approval must be acceptable to
both Peoples and MEH, People should not have ""sole"" authority to prepare
and file all applications.
                                         16. Sect. 10.2. See comments above
re Governmental Approval. Also, I don't think there is a need for the word
""expressly"" in the first sentence.            17. Sect. 11.1. Should the
Section require consent for transfer by operation of law if we wish to have
this requirement in the event that the Hub facilities are sold?

          18. Sect. 15.1 (a). If this type of provision is going to be
included, should there at least be an initial period (say a year) to get
started which doesn't trigger a termination right? The NIGAS Agreement had
a section along these lines.
          19. Sect. 15.1 (f). See comments above re Governmental Approval.
                                                   20. Former 15.1 (f) now
deleted. This provided that the Agency Agreement could be terminated is MEH
is dissolved. This seems necessary to me.          21. 15.1 (g) Peoples
wishes to have sole discretion to change its Facilities or the GTC, but
proposes to limit MEH's termination right in the event that such a change
impairs the HUB's marketability. It seems reasonably to allow MEH to
terminate if it believes that HUB marketability is impaired, without a need
to demonstrate reasonableness.
                                         22. Sect. 17.1 I don't understand
why Peoples wishes to require confidentiality for the compensation
sections. The Illinois Commission Staff and interested parties would have
access to this information under a protective agreement. This would
unnecessarily complicate the approval process and I don't know what there
is to gain from secrecy. These provisions were part of the public record in
the NIGAS approval case.                                     That's all.

Dear Mr. Schaeffer,

Apologies for the delay in responding to your e-mail below.

Jeff has given your proposal serious consideration.  However, given the 
current demands on his time, he has decided to decline your offer to join the 
Cogent Communications Advisory Committee.

On behalf of Jeff, many thanks for the opportunity and best wishes for 
success.

Dear Jeff,

Hope you are doing well.  It has been quite a long time since we last spoke
when I was with Pathnet.  I have since started another company called Cogent
Communications and the company has been progressing very well in the last
year.

I'm in the process of putting together an Advisory Committee for the company
composed of industry, business, and political leaders.  I think your depth
of experience in telecom could add a lot of value to the company and am
looking to gauge your interest level in joining the committee.  The
commitment is limited to one meeting per year and you would receive stock in
the company.  Thus far we have commitments from Sergio Zyman of Coca Cola
and are in discussions with Bob Dole and Vernon Jordan.

Cogent is a facilities-based ISP offering very high bandwidth Internet
access to business users in the top tier cities in the US.  Utilizing the
latest in fiber-optic technology, we've built an all optical nationwide
network and are offering 100mbps non-oversubscribed service for a flat rate
of $1,000 per month.  Feel free to take a look at our website at
www.cogentco.com.  The company has raised over $350MM in financing to date
with investors including Oak Investment Partners, Broadview Capital, Texas
Pacific Group, Capital Research, and Worldview Technology Partners.

Please give me a call/email at your earliest convenience.  I look forward to
speaking with you and catching up.

Sincerely,

Dave Schaeffer, CEO

Ned,

Regarding the Waha storage, the west desk does not have a strong need for 
this storage but we are always willing to show a bid based on the current 
summer/winter spreads and cycling value.  The following assumptions were made 
to establish our bid:  5% daily injection capacity, 10% daily withdrawal 
capacity, 1% fuel (injection only), 0.01/MMBtu variable injection and 
withdrawal fees.  Also an undiscounted  June 01 to January 02 spread of $0.60 
existed at the time of this bid.

Bid for a 1 year storage contract beginning June 01 based on above 
assumptions:  $0.05/ MMBtu/Month ($0.60/Year).  Demand charges only.

I am not sure if this is exactly what you need or not.  Please call or email 
with comments.

Subject: Carlos Sole

Barbara and Peggy,

I understand that we may be looking for someone to provide some assistance on 
the Mexico transactions, and that Carlos Sole may be interviewing for the 
position.  Carlos and I worked together on multiple transactions in Mexico 
while I was with EECC.  In fact, I hired Carlos to work with me because 90% 
of what I was doing was in  Mexico, and Carlos has a good background in 
transactional work in Mexico. He assumed ""first chair"" responsibility for all 
the Mexico work when I left EECC. Carlos is bilingual in Spanish, and he 
conducts business in Spanish quite comfortably.  He is a very bright, a hard 
worker, and a lot of fun to work with.  I personally think he would be an 
excellent addition to our group.

Please let me know if I can provide any more information about Carlos.

Joaner Boner -
Well, in my usual slacker fashion, I haven't bought my plane ticket yet - so 
I totally think you should go to Sunriver. I might come visit you there if 
there's room. But an S.F. visit is imminent, I swear. I'll call you soon to 
discuss the alcoholism of your co-worker/boyfriend, as well as the techniques 
for acquiring this sexy body for the new year. Work is consuming my life and 
eating me whole - very chaotic what with hiding all the power from you guys 
and whatnot. Imagine the pressure. Another reason it might not be the best 
time for me to come is that I'm moving on Friday. Amber and Molly and I found 
a big, beautiful house in NE, near Grant High - it's kickass. But it's sucked 
away all of my money and will probably take over every free moment for the 
next month just to get it set up. If you want, you should stop by for a sleep 
over on your way to Bend. We'll throw a party. And what's up with the wrist 
disease? Are you not taking your calcium or something? I'm convinced that 
these wacky desk jobs are aging us youthful beauties prematurely. At least 
that's the excuse I like to give when I come in to work looking like I just 
bathed in a life-sized ashtray. Call me soon - I'm really curious to find out 
why Brooks is doing the chicken dance EVER let alone in your room in the 
middle of the night. Wheeew!

Happy Sexy Body New Year,
Kate

Subject: Sexy Body for the New Year!!!


Hey Kate -
My subject line is a duplicate of an email I received this morning from some
beauty .com site.  Steve Cross puts me on all of these stupid mailing lists,
so I thought I'd be retarded and put that in my subject line because it's a
stupid subject!

Anyway, how are you doing these days?  I wanted to write and see if you
really got your ticket to come visit over President's Day weekend!  I
totally want you to come down!!!  I'd be so excited.  If you don't, though,
I think I'm going to look into going up to Bend for the weekend to chill in
SunRiver and snowboard a little!  Maybe you could meet me there and stay w/
me at my parents house?  Ash is going up for sure.  If you're coming down
here, that's GREAT!  I'd be SOOO excited.

I'm on complete crack today, if you can't tell.  I have carpal tunnell, too.
Last night I woke up at 2am to Brooks coming home from a drunken night out
and he started doing the chicken dance in my room and almost knocked over my
entire shelf, tv, etc.  Then he started babbling about nothing, passed
straight out and started totally snoring.  So I didn't get back to sleep
until like 4:30 and had to wake up at 6.  I was livid this morning.  I'm
such a bitch, but I need my sleep!  Dammit.

Anyway, write soon!   I miss you!
joan

Please send me an excel spreadsheet which depicts the value that you see 
associated with the heat rate spread option.  I want to make sure that I 
understand exactly how you propose valuing the transaction and how this value 
would be booked.  As such, please provide the following detail:

Will we be valuing/booking a series of monthly call options or a series of 
daily call options?
What power curve are we valuing the deal against - PJM East or West Hub?
Please send me the current fuel curve that you are converting to $/MWh to 
value the deal?
What volatilities are you using to value the options - monthly volatilities 
or intra-day volatilities or a blend of the two (if blending please show me 
what formula you using to blend the two vols)?
What expiration date are you using, i.e.: for monthly call options the 15th 
of the relevant month, and for daily options?
What correlation are you assuming, 15% flat for twenty years?
Are you deducting all operating expenses from the value of the option?
Are you using the ""SPRDOPT"" Exotic Options function to value the option?
Are you using the $/MWh VOM dollar amount as your strike?
Has Don provided the fixed payment stream?  This stream should be covering 
both P&I and not just principal.

Yvan, and Ben, please provide answers to these question via written 
correspondence so that their is limited probability of misunderstanding.  
Thank you both very much for your time and help thus far.  Furthermore, I 
would like to reiterate that RAC's goal, prior to quoting any credit reserve, 
is to be 100% confident that: (i) the methodology that is being employed is 
consistent among the internal groups; and (ii) the inherent value of the 
price risk management contracts matches.  This enables RAC to manage the 
associated risk during the life of the transaction both effectively and 
appropriately.

Well, the staff level is prettly low here, for just about every group related to HPL.  Stacey did leave, so I am back to trading Waha.  However, it's going a lot better this time.  I am actualy enjoying it somewhat.  With the majority of the desk leaving, I am looking into moving into the day trading arena for the new Texas Desk.  We'll see how that goes.  Bidweek was kinda rough this time.  In addition to Stacey leaving during the middle of the week, we have some major outages on the A/S line where we have to stay balanced on Texoma and balanced on the south end.  The line has been split into two seperate systems.  Handling that has been a constant battle.  Plus, with the pending sale, people just don't care as much about the business.  It's a little harder to get things done.

Anyway, things are going pretty good at the house.  But, the list of things to fix and do keeps getting longer and longer.  We are extremely busy.  The kids are loving the stairs.  You ought to see Jake go down.  We taught him to turn around backwards and crawl down the stairs on his belly.  Well, that was too slow for him.  Now, he get's on his belly, feet up in the air, and slides down, barely skiming the stairs.  He looks a penguin sliding down a snow bank, except on his stomach.  Cole is doing his best to either run Jake off or make him tough.  Cole runs over Jake with his toys, pushes Jake out the way, or just walks right over him.  It doesn't affect Jake, though, he gets right back up and keeps on going.

Anyway, I need to get back to work.  Hope the family is doing well.  Maybe you can come down for lunch next week.  I'll give you a call in the next couple of days.

Good news:  I've just received word that the FERC has issued an order denying 
SoCal's request for rehearing of the Gallup order.  FERC also ordered that 
TW's request for rehearing (which asked the Commission not to require TW to 
disclose discounted rates) is now moot because we filed a discount report at 
the time required by Section 284.7(b)(6) of the Commission's rules (as we 
always do).  

If SoCal is still feeling vindictive, they can file an appeal in the D.C. 
Circuit.  I believe their window is 60 days.  In any event, the pendency of 
an appeal would not affect the validity of our certificate.

If you have any questions, let me know.

Subject: Floating LNG Terminal

Folks,

As a follow-up to Scott Neal's inquiry this morning concerning 
portable/floating LNG opportunities for California, I have learned that no 
such capability currently exists.
According to Todd Peterson of Enron Global LNG, exploitation of this 
opportunity has been the topic of some industry articles but no one, as far 
as we know, has
constructed such a vessel.  

I did come across a proposed design for an LNG floating terminal by the 
Italian company,Tecnomare.   I contacted them and they indicated that  they 
have not
built such a vessel.  It is estimated that construction of such a vessel 
would take 2-3 years, and as one might imagine, achieving the required 
operational and 
environmental performance in such a vessel would be quite substantial.  
Attached is a link to a relatively brief description of the proposed vessel,
http://www.tecnomare.it/marine/project/ling.htm

Please let me know if any further research is needed.

Hi Catherine,

I don't remember who actually gives the notice, but in anticipation of the 
funding of the escrow tomorrow, here are the docs.



I understand there is also a two day notice.  I don't believe I've seen a 
form for that one yet.

Who should send this out tomorrow after we get the fed ref?

Thanks,

Kay

Hi Vince:
This Zeigham Khokher at the University of Texas at  Austin, Finance 
Department.
?
I need some publicly available data that  unfortunately is not available 
here.? It is basically the historical prices  for price of oil, gas and gold 
futures contracts and options.
?
Again the data is strictly public info and not  proprietary at all.? Let me 
know if there is a central data person at Enron  who would be able to help.? 
All help will be of course gratefully  acknowledged.

Hope all is well, I hear you will be giving a talk  at UT this fall?and look 
forward to seeing you then.

As part of our monthly testing we review the monthly Natural Gas P & L 
Statement and identify specific regions for which we would like to review 
additional documentation.  Please find below, the regions that we have 
identified.  We are requesting that you supply the P & L top pages for the 
last day of the month for those regions that are applicable to you.  Once we 
have reviewed these top pages, we will be contacting you to discuss the 
drivers of these regions.  Please let me know if you have any questions or 
comments.

Subject:  Book and EPRM articles




Hi Vince,

I was wondering how the chapter of the book is coming along??! Do you want  me
to make 'noise' tomorrow or to leave you until after Easter?

Until then, I wanted to discuss with you an idea  that Les and I have been
throwing around concerning writing a series of articles  for Risk's 'Energy 
and
Power Risk Management'. We would like to propose to  them?that we would write 
an
article a month, covering practical issues  dealing with energy modelling and
energy derivative pricing and risk management.  The articles would be based 
upon
sections of the book so as to promote the book,  and to reduce the effort/time
involved by using?already produced material.  We would like to cover some very
practical topics, but we?won't be giving  too much away as the articles are 
only
1 or 2 pages long.

Each article would be of?the  form;

- introduce?the concept
- give an example using real data
- discuss the problem with a case study
- provide a discussion
- sum up

I've included a list of potential articles at the  end of this e-mail. For
example, for the first one,  ""Estimation of mean reversion in spot energy
prices"", we would introduce  the concept of mean reversion,?show a graph of an
equity index and an  energy price?for illustration of our point, estimate the
parameter for a  series of energies over a number of seasons, and finally,
discuss the  results.

We?are wondering if you would like to be  involved in this project? Your
involvement needn't take much time (although it  is up to you). The kind of
input we are hoping for (again, this is up to you) is  that you?would?review 
the
list of articles and  provide?suggestions of additions or deletions, suggest
reasonable data sets  or case studies to work with on each article, and then 
to
run your eye over  ""near finished"" articles, which?we would supply to you for
your?practical experience?input.? Would something like this  interest you? If 
it
did, we would try to sell Risk on making it a regular  monthly ""feature"" of
EPRM, authored by all three of us.

We are hoping to present our proposal to Risk in  the next few weeks, so 
please
let us know if you are interested.

Best regards.

Chris.


Potental EPRM articles;

1- Estimation of mean reversion in spot energy  prices (with parameters
estimated for oil, gas, and electricity data over  different seasons)

2- Estimation of jumps in spot energy prices (with  parameters estimated for
oil, gas, and electricity data over different  seasons)

3- Simulating a mean reverting spot price process  for pricing energy
derivatives (with case study applied to an Asian option on  oil)

4- Simulating a jump / diffusion spot price process  for pricing energy
derivatives (with case study applied to a Swaption on natural  gas)

5- Simulating a mean reverting jump / diffusion  spot price process for 
pricing
energy derivatives (with case study applied to  hourly caps on spot 
electricity)

6- An analytical pricing formula for pricing caps  in a mean reverting spot
price model (with example applied to a cap on natural  gas fitting the Forward
curve and volatlity structure)

7- using a tree consistent with the forward curve  and vols for pricing swing
options

8- implying a single?factor vol function from  market Futures option prices 
and
variation of parameters thru time

9- adding jump volatility to the tree

10- An analytical pricing formula for pricing caps  in a multi-factor forward
curve model(with example applied to the same cap on  natural gas and a
discussion on the differences between the two  approaches)

11- Estimating volatility functions for  multi-factor forward curve models 
(with
estimates of oil data over different  periods)

12- Estimating volatility functions for  multi-factor forward curve model from
market option prices

13- pricing swing option in multi factor model  using tree for exercise 
strategy

14- comparison of VaR methodoligies applied to the  same energy derivativ
portfolio.",medium,low,high

Hi Eric,

I just got the only remaining reservations at RC's but they are at 5.  At
this point, I am sure that it will be next to impossible to get anything
else, anywhere else.  I have been trying to contact a new, local restaurant
near here but their line has been busy.  They do have a prix fixe menu
though, unlike RC's.  Let me know what you want to do.  LU-M  Have a great
trip and be careful.

Shane and I spoke yesterday regarding the USD curve. Whilst taking a curve 
other than the day end curve is relatively easy to do (once we have agreed a 
formal procedure and changed the IT feeds) and would give us only minor P&L 
concerns on a daily basis there is an impact on determining and hedging our 
USD cashflows. This would undoubtedly be a cost to the UK business. Shane is 
going to put a note together to outline the issues and have a stab at 
attaching a monetary cost (although I expect he will have to guesstimate the 
amounts). Depending on the size this will need to be communicated to the 
business heads here in London.

Rick,
Shane Dallman and I are trying to speak with James to discuss the Libor Curve 
and its impact on London's reporting.  The Libor curve is published daily in 
Houston at 3:00 pm (CST) at the close of US Trading.  

The Global Products books are now final closed from Houston so their areas 
should not be impacted.

We will update you when we have spoken to James regarding his areas and 
possible ways Rate & Currency can assist.

Subject: UK Submission of Positions

Rick,

Thanks you for your note below. We are today implementing a flash P&L 
process. We aim to report daily numbers at 7am Houston time and will start 
today with the P&L. We will build on this and hope to have draft positions 
and VAR for most books within a week or so. There will be a reconciliation of 
flash to final numbers which will be included in our return to Houston. 
 
I will put together a note on the London DPR production process which goes 
into the process we currently have, the process we actually need to have, and 
the obstacles that are in the way. I would expect this to be finalised 
tomorrow. Obtaining the USD interest rate curve on a more timely basis is 
just one of our problems but it is unfortunately by no means our only or most 
serious problem.

James

Need your help on the following: Each day we are delayed in finalising var, 
p&L and positions because the UK must wait for a USD  interest rate curves 
before submitting their data to Houston. I am also told that it is really not 
necessary to wait for this curve and the data could be submitted close of 
business London. Even if there was some minor inaccuracy from this method it 
would be better than what we have now. This would greatly improve the 
efficiency (by 4 to 6 hours) in reporting to senior management. Can you guys 
initiate this change or get me to the right person there. Thanks, Rick

I have set up the following BPA account numbers since we have been submitting 
dec bids at Malin the past few days:

CISO to PUGET  882716
CISO to WWP       681713
CISO to SCL         882790
CISO to Tacoma 882791

I realize these counterparties can pick up at malin however, I thought it 
would be useful to have these accounts set up in case they are unable or 
unwilling to pick up at Malin. Also I have added an account number for 
Turlock to SCL.  SCL has been willing to do Buy/Resales from their system to 
Malin recently and this should be useful given that Snohomish has recently 
been unwilling to do so.
 
TURLOCK to SCL  790612

These numbers have all been added to the RT BPA Account #'s spreadsheet in 
P:/realtime.  Thank you for your attention to this matter. ",low,low,

Subject: Risk Book Post ID's for EOL Reporting

There has apparently been some misunderstanding regarding the scope of 
calculations that must be covered under the Post ID's submitted for EOL 
reporting each night. Many desks are turning in post IDs which only cover 
books in which EOL activity has taken place, thus ommitting many other 
non-eol trades. What is needed is post IDs which will collectively cover the 
entire universe of gas trading which has taken place on a given desk. In 
running the collective post ID's we need to be able to capture all trading 
which has taken place on a given day and the scope of the post ID's must 
cover this. ",low,low,

Hi Mike,

Thanks for the update.  Unfortunately, the Civic Club is unable to run the
article in The Islander, because of its political nature.  President Kathleen
Gay reviewed the article, as it was previously written, and advised me last
night that it is against Civic Club policy and bylaws to be involved in
political issues.

If you have questions or comments, please contact Kathleen.

Subject: Goldendale


Hey Dick, I don't want to beat a dead horse here, but I did want to reiterate 
out need for  the GE 7FA's  for our Florida projects. Although I understood 
from you that Goldendale was effectively done, I understand that you haven't 
yet gone through the dash process, so therefore a window of opportunity. We 
are looking to pay up to $40,000,000 for a GE 7FA for Ft. Pierce in addition 
to a commitment on the combined-cycle EPC contract. Our customer at Ft. 
Pierce is heavily engaged in finalizing contracts and will be prepared to 
execute in December. We must be able to commit to them (showing title to the 
que position) by then. 

I'd like you to compare your anticipated earnings on the Goldendale deal with 
earnings from moving this turbine to Florida. The $40 million should give you 
app. $3 million above cost, as well as incremental profits from the EPC 
contract. Also, you should know that we feel the Florida market has 
significant upside potential for Enron from a merchant standpoint and 
anticipate that our first-mover advantage will result in significant earnings.

Please let me know how you think Enron should proceed in comparing the two 
projects. Thanks Dick.",low,low,

That's funny, that they still had the same outfit you looked at back in the fall.  If I'm not mistaken, the ""O"" magazine, the one that Oprah Winfrey publlishes had a coupon for August Max stores.

Chris--
Have you called Charlie yet with bids on the three CES transport contracts we 
discussed?   
Also, have you received from CES the official in writing notification of 
their withdrawal from certain c&i markets?

I want to make sure we have enough time to handle all the transportation 
contract issues, etc. for June bid week.  Please advise.

For December 21, 2000 activity, I reported a weighted average price of $16.00 
for activity for December 22-26, 2000.

The weighted average trade price via Enron Online will reflect a price of 
$15.76, but coupled with the volume not transacted online, this price was 
estimated to be a $16.00 midpoint.  Specificially the following trades were 
transacted over the telephone:

Nicor Gas Company  $18.16  20,000  Via ANR @ Hampshire
Altrade    GDD +.05 10,000  NGPL Nicor
WPS    GDD    5,000  NGPL Nicor
Nicor Gas Company  $12.00  20,000  NGPL Nicor
PG&E    $14.00   9,000  NGPL Nicor
Kaztex    $18.16       4,000  NBPL/Nicor

 
The reason for the interest in this time period is as follows:

Nicor Gas Company observed their company holiday on December 22nd, while most 
companies observed the company holiday on December 26th.  As a result, 
volumes were traded for the December 22-26 time period.  Gas Daily published 
a price of $15.70 for the December 22-26 time period.  Nicor Gas Company made 
a decision to buy gas on December 22nd for the December 23-26 time period.  I 
received several phone calls from various marketing companies expressing 
concern that Gas Daily was going to revise the posting, based on the minimal 
activity that transacted on December 22nd.  

While, my practice is to simply take the price as reported on Enron Online, 
from time-to-time, the there will be significant volumes transacted over the 
telephone that will impact the Enron Online price.  My volume  is a little 
over-stated, but simply  from a cursory glance standpoint, as opposed to 
intentionally reporting erroneous information.",low,low,

Kay:

I talked with Gary Hickey at Dynegy this afternoon regarding their interest 
in doing a deal involving one or both of the following:

 1.  Purchasing 100% of the member interests of an ENA development project,

 2.  A transaction involving generation equipment (7EA, W 501D5A, or LM 6000)

Gary is a V.P. over Dynegy's eastern U.S. and International Development 
group.  He indicated that their preferred areas for a development project 
transaction would be in the SERC, PJM, and Illinois regions.  I described the 
equipment available for transactions and Gary said that he would take a few 
days to look into it and get back to me.

Please draft a CA that would encompass these potential transaction 
structures.  I am sure that Enron and Dynegy must have a form of CA that has 
been agreed upon in the past.  Let's see if we can use that form with only 
the minimal required changes.  Please forward me the draft so that I can get 
it to Gary by Monday.  I am cc Kathleen as she is looking into the 
Constellation Power CA for you.

Thanks,
Fred

Okay, given the weather conditions out there right now I'm going to have to
put a little extra planning into my packing.  I figure we'll be engaging in
the following activities:  beach, shopping, dinner, going out, church and I
think you mentioned something about a museum.  Given those various
situations, I was wondering what you suggest I bring along.  For instance,
am I going to need a jacket at night or is a sweater sufficient and what do
you suggest in the way of ""go-out"" clothes?   Also, let me know if you hear
anything about the spas...that way I can try and make a reservation (=20
figure Friday mid-morning would be a good time.  We could go for a run in
the morning and then I could go for the massage while you study.)
Supposedly, it's going to be warmer on Saturday than Friday so maybe we
should plan Saturday as our beach day...of course, I'm completely flexible.
As for brunch on Sunday, I did a little research yesterday and came up with
a few suggestions... George's on the Cove, The Marine Room, Brockton Villa,
Trattoria Acqua and Pacifica Del Mar.  All of these, with the exception of
Pacifica Del Mar, are in La Jolla so I suppose we'd have to take that into
consideration...There is a Presbyterian church in La Jolla that could be an
option (but if your friends have suggestions I defer to their judgement
both religiously and gastronomically).  All of the places mentioned above,
in addition to The Fish Market, Cafe Japengo and En Fuego Cantina & Grill,
also sounded good for just regular meals.  Depending on local culture (and
your own opinion) I was just going to let you know that I can go straight
from the airport somewhere if you want on Thursday.  I didn't know what
time people typically go out to eat or if you even wanted to go out
Thursday night.

I know, I know...I had way too much time on my hands yesterday.

In the end, I'll really do anything and go anywhere...just thought I'd help
out with a few suggestions.

Love,
Susan

We don't have to go to FW for the rodeo.  I just thought that would be fun
to do, and my mom wants Michael to come so badly.  We can always just go
for a visit.  In fact, Michael and I can go alone some time.

 &=20
CONFIDENTIAL


=09


Eric Shaw's team has learned that an investigation has been initiated by th=
e=20
Turkish military to expose and eliminate corruption in the Turkish energy=
=20
sector.

On January 6, the military took seven energy sector bureaucrats into custod=
y.=20
In the following days, other officials from TEA? (the electricity generatio=
n=20
monopoly) and the Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources (MENR) and=20
executives from a number of Turkish companies were also taken into custody.=
=20

While many of the bureaucrats and executives have been released, a leaked=
=20
report from the military investigators suggests that the operation is wide=
=20
ranging and may ultimately target the Minister of Energy and Natural=20
Resources and other senior energy sector bureaucrats and businessmen.=20

Enron Implications

Trakya - One Turkish newspaper has reported that Enron=01,s  478 MW Trakya =
power=20
project was being investigated.  This has not been reported anywhere else. =
=20
Because the power price at Trakya has been the target of criticism in the=
=20
past, we are not surprised by this report. Although an investigation is=20
always a possibility, other than the one newspaper report, there has been n=
o=20
indication, official or otherwise, that an investigation is planned or=20
underway.
=20
GAMA - It has also been reported that the wife of Gorkhan Yardim, the Gener=
al=20
Manager of BOTA? (the natural gas monopoly), works at GAMA, our Turkish=20
partner in the Trakya project, and that his expensive car was a gift from=
=20
GAMA. GAMA has told us, and Yardim has defended himself publicly by saying,=
=20
that his wife has been working at GAMA since 1993, long before Yardim had=
=20
risen to his current position of power at BOTA?, and that the car was not a=
=20
gift from GAMA. It is worth noting, however, that there have been a number =
of=20
newspaper reports questioning GAMA=01,s role in a controversial gas marketi=
ng=20
deal being undertaken by their TurRusGas joint venture with Gazprom and BOT=
A?.

Outlook

It is still not clear how or when this investigation will end. In the mediu=
m=20
and long term, this will be good news for Enron and other reputable Turkish=
=20
or foreign companies which have found it difficult to do transparent energy=
=20
deals in Turkey in the past. In the short term, however, it is likely to=20
result in a marked decrease in meaningful activity in the Turkish energy=20
sector, as worried bureaucrats, innocent and guilty, lay low.=20

We will continue to monitor developments, especially with regard to the=20
Trakya project, and report as necessary.

Subject: NSTAR 6-month Transaction


I would like to personally thank and congratulate everyone involved in 
helping ENA bring closure to the NSTAR wholesale power transaction.  Any 
transaction of this nature requires support from many people and I appreciate 
everyone's hard work in making this transaction a reality.  In addition, I 
believe ENA is well positioned for a longer term transaction with NSTAR.   I 
would encourage John Llodra and Jeff Ader to work closely together to create 
the best value proposition for Enron on the long term deal.
Strict Confidentiality language is embedded in the 6-month NSTAR transaction, 
and it is extremely important that everyone involved honors the zero 
tolerance nature of this Confidentiality provision.  The bottom line is that 
we cannot disclose anything about this deal to any third partiies, including 
the mere existence of the deal.   If we do not respect this provision fully, 
we will jeapordize our goodwill with the customer and thus our ability to 
move forward with a longer term transaction.  In addtion, there could be 
negative legal ramnifications.

Thanks again for a job well done.  If I missed anyone who was involved in the 
transaction, please forward this e-mail to those individuals.",low,low,

Yes, lets continue to have the pre-meetings formerly known as Mike's every Mon. at 8:30 (pls put on my calendar Emily).  I'll be in Houston this Monday so just come to my office at 8:30 if you are both here.  Dot, pls cover the staff meeting on Monday, April 9 as I'll be on vacation.  Also, pls cover the Derrick large GC meeting at 9:00 am on April 12 as I'll be at NN's Keyex meeting in Cal.  (I may be able to call in to this but would like you to cover anyway in case something goes haywire). Thanks df

Subject: FW: A Little Humor to Start Your Day 


Computer Gender 

An English teacher was explaining to the students 
the 
concept of gender 
association in the English language; noting how 
hurricanes at one time were 
given only female names, and how ships and planes 
were 
usually referred to 
as ""she."" One of the students raised her hand and 
asked, 
""What gender is a 
computer?"" 

The teacher wasn't certain and divided the class 
into two 
groups:  males 
in one, females in the other, and asked them to 
decide if 
a computer should 
be masculine or feminine. Both groups were asked 
to give 
four reasons for 
their recommendations. 

    The group of women concluded that computers 
should be 
referred to as 
masculine because: 

1. In order to get their attention, you have to 
turn them 
on. 

2. They have a lot of data but are still clueless. 

3. They are supposed to help you solve your 
problems, but 
half the time, 
they ARE the problem. 

4. As soon as you commit to one, you realize that, 
if you 
had waited a 
little longer, you could have had a better model. 

    The men, on the other hand, decided that 
computers 
should definitely be 
referred to as feminine because: 

1. No one but their creator understands their 
internal 
logic. 

2. The native language they use to communicate 
with other 
computers is 
incomprehensible to everyone else. 

3.  Even your smallest mistakes are stored in 
long-term 
memory for later 
retrieval. 

4. As soon as you make a commitment to one, you 
find 
yourself spending half 
your paycheck on accessories for it.

I received today notarized copies of the Resolutions of Support from the
Edgecombe County Commissioners, the City Council and Mayor, and the local
economic development organization, Carolinas Gateway.

I will file them with the Commission when we file the cost data late this
week or early next week.  That would also be a good time to file any project
updates, such as information regarding the generators.

Cove Point LNG Completes Open Season With 3 Pacts

06/09/2000
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

  HOUSTON -(Dow Jones)- Cove Point LNG Limited Partnership, a subsidiary of
Columbia Energy Group (CG) Friday completed its open season for firm liquid
natural gas (LNG) tanker discharging service at its Cove Point terminal near
Lusby, Md., the company said.

  Cove Point LNG executed binding agreements with Coral LNG Inc., El Paso
Merchant Energy-Gas, LP (EPG) and a subsidiary of BP Amoco Corp. (BPA).
  The three customers will begin service agreements upon receipt of regulatory
approvals.

  The open season process for the proposed service began Feb. 16, with the new
service providing 4.25 billion cubic feet of storage capacity and 750 million
cubic feet per day of terminal and pipeline capacity to accommodate LNG
imports by the three companies.

  The open season agreements also provide for a 2.5 Bcf (vapor equivalent)
storage capacity expansion of Cove Point's Lusby, Md. location.

  Cove Point anticipates filing an application with the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission to provide the LNG tanker discharging service, to
recommission Cove Point marine facilities and to construct new storage
facilities including the new LNG storage.

  Columbia Energy Group agreed to sell partnership interests in Cove Point LNG
Limited Partnership to Williams Cos. (WMB) subsidiaries for $150 million. The
transaction should be complete in July, the companies said Friday.

		Positive Living Tip of the Day
		Monday January 29, 2001
		
		Your Environment  
		
		Do you live or work in an environment that creates undue stress in your life?
		
		If so, realize your environment plays an important role in your life. Hostile 
environments create defensiveness, and an individual's negative behavior can 
directly affect others who are trying to maintain a healthy attitude.
		
		For example, if you are working with a supervisor who constantly berates 
those under him/her in front of others, this negative behavior affects 
everyone in the office. And hanging around negative friends and family 
members can reinforce your own negative traits. (For example, your temper is 
under control as long as you are not around your older brother.) In addition, 
negative people can induce others into developing the same negative attitudes 
and behaviors that they possess. It is true the company you keep is a 
reflection on you and can influence your behavior. Steer clear of negative 
environments and begin building a positive life.

Vince/Vasant,

It has been some time since we spoke at the San Antonio conference.  
Unfortunately,as soon as I got to India I was diagnosed wih a slip disc and 
had to be in bed for a long time.

In the mean time the team continued to work on the concept of a sale to 
another state out of the Dabhol plant.  I have developed the concept whereby 
we are now looking at a firm component (over peak period), and an infirm 
power sale during the monsoon.

The series of quesions and comments from my team in te attachment below 
should help you a bit to get a feel for the proposal.  I am currently in 
Houston and reachable at 281-345-9870.  I maybe needing a surgery for the 
slip disc but am currently on medication hoping that surgery won't be needed.

I would like to wis you all a very happy X'Mas and a Great New Year, and will 
catch you in the NEw YEar in Houston to discuss this wit you further.  I can 
see that soem structuring help will be needed on this, and would like to get 
some help from your end.

Regards,
Sandeep.

Please find my comments in the word document attached. 

Please go through this and run the sensitivities and get a good idea of way 
to structure thsi.  Having gone through the comments, I feel that it maybe 
necessary to get some help on the structuring side.  I will try to get you 
some structuring expertise asap.  In the mean time, I would like you all to

Subject: Firm Power sale from Phase I - Issues

As discussed, please find enclosed  a word document which essentially 
discusses most of the issues involved with a Firm Power sale of 50 MW from 
Phase I, which would have to be sorted out with MSEB. 

Vivek & I have also worked out a methodology for computing tariff for this 
firm power sale during the peak period. In doing this, we have tried to keep 
the tariff formula as simple as possible, while simulating the PPA tariffs to 
the extent possible. (Currently, we have just shown the tariff computation; 
will put the tariff formula in the next mail)

The tariff structure & the issue list obviously need further refinement, 
before we discuss it with MSEB.

Looking forward to your comments on both the issue list as well as the tariff 
computation.




regards,

Rajesh S

fact, at the Global Operations Controllers gathering in Houston in October, 
we are going to roll out a website created for Global Risk Operations.  The 
global standards will be one of the items included, as well as contact lists 
for Operations Controllers worldwide, calendars for all Enron offices

Mike and Eric,

Informally I was told today that the new President of PDVSA Gas will be 
Nelson Nava, this is very good news for us since he has been a very strong 
supporter of the project for a long time. We have a solid relationship with 
Nelson, so I believe he could be a good sponsor for our project. More 
importantly, we will not have to educate Nelson about the project. Just in 
case you don't remember, we all met him when we visisted PDVSA-Gas earlier 
this years. The meeting in PDVSA-Gas was in his office.

Once it is official, it would be a very good idea for you Mike to call him to 
congratulate him. I will let you two know next week.

Hi,

Over the past weeks, I have been staying at home with my new daughter (a
picture is attached, though it does not do her justice).  Monday, March 12,
I intend to return to the office.

My sense is that Paul Mohler has been doing a fine job running the rate
case.  I hope you agree -- if not, please tell me.  I intend to start
reintegrating myself into the RTO West/TransConnect work, and will call to
discuss -- I'm writing now to get you thinking about it.

Stan

JM, 

The message below is related to deal #138094.  According to Joan, October is 
the last month for this deal.  However, the evergreen flag is activated in 
Sitara and a new line has been created for November.  Can you look into this 
please?

We have had a problem arise today with some deals that are being booked in 
sitara by originators and deal tickets/notebooks are not being communicated 
properly to ensure entry into TAGG & Sitara for prompt month deals.  Would 
you mind forwarding this email to your groups and asking them to copy the 
other desks on any originator notebooks that they get that involve pipelines 
on other desks.  For example, Nelson Ferries writes all of his deals on one 
sheet and all deals by pipeline are on one page.  This would simply be an 
additional step to verify all deals are being captured.  Hopefully this will 
eliminate any future problems.  If you have any suggestions for ways to 
better handle this, please let me know.  Thanks.

Subject: Houston Ballet's Miller Theater Performance of Coppelia


Houston Ballet gives free performances of Copp,lia
at Miller Outdoor Theatre in Hermann Park
8:00 p.m. Friday May 11, Saturday May 12, & Sunday May 13, 2001 
sponsored by AZURIX and ENRON

Considered the great comedy of classical ballet, Copp,lia  tells the story of 
a doll so enchantingly lifelike that she mesmerizes an entire village, 
captures the heart of a young swain named Franz and inspires the eccentric 
toymaker Dr. Copp,lius to attempt to transform her into a living, breathing 
human being. 

AZURIX and ENRON are Corporate Sponsors for Houston Ballet's Miller Theatre 
performances, helping to present these free performances of Copp,lia to the 
people of Houston.  Houston Ballet has a limited number of tickets for the 
seated area each night for employees of AZURIX and ENRON.  These tickets are 
available on a first-come, first-served basis by calling William at 
713-535-3235 no later than 5 PM today .  (Please be aware that all unoccupied 
seats are released at 10 minutes before curtain.)

Other, free, general public tickets for the seated area (max 4 per person) 
are available at the Miller Theatre 11:30 a.m. - 1:00 p.m. on the day of 
performance; for more information call 713-284-8351 for the Miller Theatre 
ticket information line.  Tickets are not required for the lawn area.  

About Coppelia
Copp,lia was first performed on May 25, 1870 at the Th,atre Imp,rial de 
L'Op,ra, featuring choreography by Arthur Saint-L,on and music by L,o 
Delibes. The work maintains a special place in the history of dance, serving 
as a kind of bridge from the glory of the French Romantic ballet in the early 
nineteenth century to the masterpieces of the Russian Imperial Theater at the 
turn of the century. Writing in The International Dictionary of Ballet, 
critic Karen Dacko analyzes the unique characteristics of the piece as 
follows: ""Copp,lia owes its longevity to its inspired, very danceable score. 
But the ballet is also remarkable for its perennial appeal and for its 
historical significance as Romanticism's grand finale and classical ballet's 
prologue.""
Copp,lia first entered Houston Ballet' repertoire in October 1974, in a 
staging by Frederic Franklin (who also performed the role of Dr. Copp,lius), 
and featuring scenery by Peter Farmer. In November 1979, former Royal Ballet 
ballerina Anne Heaton re-staged the work for the company. When Houston Ballet 
premiered its new production of the work in March 1992 featuring breathtaking 
d,cor by Desmond Heeley, Carl Cunningham of The Houston Post wrote, ""It would 
be hard to imagine anything to cap the joyous, gentle, and glorious looking 
new production of Copp,lia the splendidly prepared company of dancers and 
musicians put forth Thursday evening on Wortham Center's Brown Theater 
stage.""    (The Houston Post, March 21, 1992)
Heeley's designs for Copp,lia never fail to enchant, most notably in the 
second-act depiction of Dr. Copp,lius's workshop. The sampling of dolls on 
display pay homage to the era when automatons, or mechanical toys, were the 
rage in Europe -- and to Heeley's inexhaustible creativity. Among the 
eye-popping toys featured in  the workshop are a huge astrologer with a 
pointed hat and a robe covered in shooting stars and moons; a strongman with 
a handlebar mustache and barbells; Puss n Boots; an acrobat hanging from a 
trapeze holding the man in the moon; and a small ballerina dancing on the 
back of a goat. In the first act, the vibrant reds, golds, and oranges of the 
costumes worn by the peasants in the village conjure up a wonderfully 
picturesque vision of nineteenth century Bavaria.",low,low,

SERC

A very quiet night in SERC.  Evening peak prices fell off hard due to rain 
covering  SOCO's control area.  OPC was the best bid for the evening peak he 
21-22($60-$70).  SOCO would not show a bid for the evening peak.  For he 
21-23 SOCO began to sell about 400mw's to SCEG, SC and GTC.  The TLR called 
by TVA on the Bowen-Sequoyah has not been re-called as of 3:00 a.m.  TVA has 
not been able to bring in power from the north.   TVA must be doing well 
generation wise since they did not import power from its neighbors.  For 
off-peak SOCO was $14 @ $22.  SCEG was a $15 bid.   For friday SOCO, OPC and 
SCEG will be on the bid.       

 SERC    16 hour average:  BID  $ 42.7  OFFER $ 72.5



FRCC

Importing power into Florida was again a problem up until off-peak.  For the 
evening peak FPL and FPC were bidding in the mid 40's.  For he 22 FPL bought 
$21 and for off-peak  FPL was a mid teens bid.   Both TEC and TAL were flat 
for the evening peak and the off-peak.   With TLR's expected again for 
friday, the night guys at FPC and FPL are going to let the day guys make a 
decision on any b.o.d preschedules.

SERC- For Saturday SOCO was on the bid  in the mid 40's during the afternoon 
peak.  They were buying up to 500mw from FPL.  The Florida utilities were 
sellers due the rains they were getting in the afternoon.  SCEG was a low 
30's bid during the afternoon bid.  Duke was flat all day.  OPC was also a 
hig 30's bid much of the afternoon.  We managed to sell SOCO 200 mws for 2 
hours until TLR's ended the sale.  

 -For Sunday SOCO was a low 20' bid in the morning and in the afternoon was a 
low 30's bid.  Duke was seller  in the mid 30's all day.  SCEG was also an 
hourly seller, unfortunately SCEG was limited to where they could go.  DUKE 
and VEPCO will have hourly to sell for Monday. 


FRCC-For Saturday Florida was a seller due to rains over much of the state.  
FPL was offering 60's much of the day.  They were a big seller to SOCO much 
of Saturday.  

 -For Sunday things were a little different.  FPL was a bid in the low 60's 
for the afternoon peak.  By afternoon time TLR's prevented any power from 
going into Florida.  


ERCOT- For Saturday an afternoon schedule traded for $75 and after this went 
through ERCOT prices went up.  WE sold $75  to Reliant for HE 16.  For HE 
17-19 no power was to be found in ERCOT.  HLP was $100 bid for these hours.  
TU would not show us bid for these hours.  

 -For Sunday power was offered out at $55 with no bids(low 30's bids).  No 
transmission avail. for HE 14-19 going up to the North.  ",low,low,

To all:

Attached below please find a draft of the CRRA Filing with the DPUC regarding 
the fuel cell transaction.  There are several points that remain open that I 
would like to have cleared up by Monday afternoon.  For example, is CRRA 
filing alone or are we filing jointly?

I believe we've covered all the issues outlined by Sandra.  Please let me 
know if we've left anything out or if we need to delete anything.

I think this is a good start to us meeting our compressed timeline.  Do not 
hesitate to call me for any reason whatsoever.  The next few weeks/months are 
going to be very busy, but I know we can get to the goal line.

To quote Dave Delainey, ""Go, go, go.""

Ramesh/Wei,

I just wanted to know what your estimated time was for implementing the code 
to apply basis roll off to the benchmark quantity as well as to the open 
position quantity.  The timing is not critical for our purposes.  I just want 
to make sure it will be available before March bidweek.  If you need any 
information please let me know as soon as possible since  Thursday will be my 
last day in this group.  If you need anything after Thursday please contact 
Binh Pham.  

I have enjoyed working with you both.  Thank you for all your help.

Subject: Jeff Skilling does MS150




	

Well, the bike is inspected, a few training rides have been made, and the 
camping gear is being dusted off (yes, he is actually camping at the 
fairgrounds in LaGrange!).  Now all our fearless leader (and incidentally, 
the National Multiple Sclerosis Society's 2000 Man of the Year), Jeff 
Skilling, needs is your help in raising money for MS.

Enron's MS150 Dream Team is bigger than some townships in these parts - over 
350 Enron employees, led by Jeff, will ride from Houston to Austin under the 
Enron Flag April 15-16, and the team's goal is to raise $350,000.  I am 
challenging (is begging a better word?) each of you to pledge a certain 
amount per mile - i.e., $1, $2, $5, it's your call.  I'll even give you a 
break on the calculation and use 150 miles, even though Jeff swears it's 
closer to 170 miles (you know how he is with numbers).  Of course, a flat 
pledge is also appreciated.  And don't forget, Enron will match your pledge 
to this very worthy cause 1-1.

I hope you will join the team and help Enron maintain its status as the top 
money raiser of all MS150 rides in the NATION!  Thank you for your 
consideration.  If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to call me.

I just wanted to let you know that I got out UT Business School's application 
on Thursday, so they received it on Friday.  Megan and I are thinking about 
going down to Austin some time soon to see the school and see Austin.  Megan 
has never been down there, so if you guys would be interested in going down 
to Austin with maybe Brandon and Allison, that would be alot of fun.  Let me 
know.  If you could send an e-mail or a letter to the person you know at

Okay, so here's the debate...There's a flight out Friday night leaving 
Houston at 11:00 pm and getting into SD around 2:20 in the morning.  The next 
earlier flight leaves Houston around 5:30 pm but unfortunately there's no way 
I could make that one because of  work.  The other option is to fly in 
Saturday morning like I did last time.  I'm leaning towards leaving Friday 
night and just taking a cab to your place as long as you don't mind waking up 
to let me in.  That way we'd have all day Saturday to do things and I 
wouldn't leave on Sunday until around 3:30 (or I could even leave around 
6:00).  Anyway, I was just wondering what you think about the various 
options?  Let me know and I'll try and book this thing today.

Subject:	ETS 2001 Allocations

Attached is a file which contains the IT Infrastructure 2001 charges split by pipeline.  You will note I have added two line items: Telephone direct and Market Data direct.  These represent charges which will be billed based on actual usage and will post to the applicable cost center(s) which incurred the usage to the EIS general ledger account.  The numbers reflected in the attached file for these items are our estimate only.  If you would like to plan a different estimate, that is your call for your BU.  The remaining line items are for the items which will be billed via an SAP assessment based on the agreed plan amounts.  Please contact Kerry or me if you have questions.

Thanks,
Elise

That's great.  What about deal 452475?  We have $0.10 and we are being billed 
$0.11 for meter 25000200 on contract 1856.  Also, I faxed the Oct 2000 TXU 
invoices to Trisha Hughes so she can look into the Dec 2000 and forward 
problem.

Subject: ENA Adjustment at Nville

The results of the February 26th PVT test conducted on Nville have been 
discussed with each of you over the last three months.  As we have 
discussed....effective Sep 13th,  Anita will make the adjustments to Enron's 
inventory and pad gas to reflect the February 26th results.

I talked with Gary Wilson, and he confirmed that the revised values are 
correct.  Attached is a spreadsheet that contains the values.

The correction to the working gas includes TWO corrections.  The results of 
the February 26th test reduces the working gas by 398,487MMBTU.  In addition, 
there is a reduction of 22,101MMBTU which is the difference between the SCADA 
values (Best Available) that Anita showed on the February 29th Storage Sheet 
and the ""official"" February 29th values that Gary Wilson received from MIPS.

To summarize:
 Enron's pad gas will now be 3,993,310MMBTU, instead of 4,223,000MMBTU.
 Enron's working gas will be reduced by 420,588MMBTU.


Call me if there are any questions.

That is not the issue.  By putting us in the middle between GTB and Solar we 
would be the ones that would have to resolve any differances between the wo 
if the unit does not function properly.  The whole deal gets complicated 
since there is a design engineer. oerator and equipment manufacturer and we 
get in the middle between the equipment manufacturer and owner.  If the unit 
does operate properly, everyone will point fingers at everyone else,  I have 
seen this happen coutless times on EE&CC projects.  Why do I want to take 
this risk on an international project that according to Jerry's own numbers 
gets me about $800,ooo in current perios earnings and another $400'ooo 
deferred over many years.  It just is not worth the time and risk for that 
kind of money.  I think Phil Lowry agrees with this assessment also.",low,low,

John, I plan on grabbing not only a digital camera but also my video camera 
to handle the panarama part of the equations.  In conversations with Doug 
Cebryk, it looks like the primary routes are Interstate 17 and El Paso's 
existing right of way south.  I spoke with Kevin Hyatt about a possible route 
that exists south to a power plant between station 1 and Kingman Az, and then 
heading southeast into the Phoenix area, but didnt know if the economics 
would work out. Ive got ENSR looking at other routes that might hold 
promise.  I also plan on addressing what might be considered sensitive areas 
of potential impact (streams, rivers, riparian habitat, difficult terrain, 
population and  critical habitat  issues etc)  Ill have a report to you 
shortly after the trip...

Subject: Sun Devil - Helicopter Fly-Over of Routes


	

Larry,

Please give me a report following your fly-over of the route with Doug 
Cebryk.  I am very interested in what you see and the potentials that are 
there.  Don't forget to take your camera.  Pictures (slides) would be most 
helpful as we work through the early planning stages for the greenfield 
portion.  As the primary route begins to solidify with alternates, we will 
need to develop some preliminary maps.  It is my understanding that no maps 
of the route will be released with sign-off from the entire group of: Hyatt, 
Taylor, Veatch and Shafer.

After we receive the ""fatal-flaw"" desk-top analysis from ENSR (Sept. 21 - 
although I hope to get it sooner), I would offer that several events should 
be scheduled to expedite the project as follows:
1. If the open season reflects that we have a project and Eric Gadd approves, 
a couple of quick meetings will be held with strategic groups to discuss the 
project potential (TNC, State Land Managing agencies, US Forest Service, 
etc).  These strategic groups will be identified by the ENSR fatal-flaw 
analysis.
2. Simultaneously, we will begin working with ENSR (if the open season 
reflects that we have a project) on developing a full scoped Environmental 
Strategy for Sun Devil (this will include an RFP that will immediately go out 
soliciting bids for the Resource Reports and permits). 
3. We will work with Steve Veatch and Joe Hartso to schedule a meeting with 
the FERC Staff (we need the commitment of the State Land Managing Agencies, 
US Forest Service, etc. to collaborate with the FERC on the NEPA review) to 
introduce the project and solicit their commitment to offer staff resources 
early in the process.
4. We will also need to develop a Public Relations and Government Affairs 
strategy which will identify the early meetings that need to be held with 
local, state, federal jurisdictional governing bodies and politicians - so 
the right folks have a heads-up on the project before it hits the news 
media.  This also includes developing a strategy on where and when the 
project will formally be announced (i.e., news conference in Phoenix or 
Houston, etc.).  A $580 Million project will be a big deal in the Phoenix 
area and for the Southwest.

I know there is more, but this will help to keep some of the early events 
coordinated.  John Shafer

Subject: Re: New Associates  

In the fundamentals group under Hunter, there is also research going on 
regarding LNG, and distillates, (and gas, weather, etc).  Vikas' background 
is in crude and products, and worked at Aquiva with two of Lagrasta's 
marketers.  I agreed to take him (6 months ago) and was planning for him to 
research crude/products.  Celeste Roberts knows the conversations we had with 
Vikas in particular becuase he wanted to start meeting people in my group and 
originally did not come through the associate program, where we finally put 
him, and she was involved from the beginning.  Li Sun is a Wharton MBA that 
Lavo did not originally pick when he went through the list with you, and was 
slated to go elsewhere.    I picked her up, after that, and she too is 
someone about whom Celeste and I had many conversations. I had met her last 
summer, and at Wharton recruiting events.  Prior to John's coming down 
Celeste and I had agreed she could come into my organization (gas) to do 
research, or to work with Vince--she is an unbelievable modeler.  I have no 
idea who the other two are or where they are going, and have not met either 
of them.  

I suspect now that we have delineated recruiting and staffing, which occurred 
recently, we won't have this confusion among the associate program 
administrators again.  

Not trying to kill you,

Jeff

risk business in gas and east power in the short run.  This was well planned 
effort.

Dave and John, I spoke to Jeff Shenkman and he has indicated that the 
following new associates are to support him in his role in Global Markets:

Dustin Collins
Vikas Dwivedi
Li Sun

Although Jeff mentioned a fourth associate, these are the only 3 that are 
identified in our system.

John after speaking with you, it is clear that you have not been in contact 
with Jeff regarding these associates supporting him.

Dave, can we discuss this matter?  I can be reached at 713/853-7351.  My

Subject: Updated CES Jun'00 FOM Requirements


The attached file is an update of the CES FOM June'00 request that was
transmitted on 5/26/00.  The changes between this version and the original
version are listed in the worksheet labelled ""Comments"".   The only changes
versus Friday's transmittal are to AGL volumes delivered on Transco.

The worksheet labelled 'Total Reqs.' and the one labelled 'Jun00 EPA Vols' 
show
volume requirements at the various citygates.  I have not adjusted our volume
requirements to reflect supply from local production behind some LDCs per 
Chris
Germany's e-mail of 5/24/00.  However, I have inserted notes indicating where
and what portion of the citygate volumes shown, will be supplied by local
production per Chris's aforementioned e-mail.

Also:  The volumes in the attached are requested pursuant to the 12/99 Energy
Purchase Agreement between Enron and CES.  During June 2000 CES will be
procuring additonal volumes from Enron under a separate deal, which should not
be confused with this request.

Vince,

Since a number of individuals in the group are interested in Java training,   
I checked to see what an internal course would cost.   We can have an 
internal class for up to 15 people for a fee of $15k.    Clayton Vernon also 
indicated that we might be able to share some of the cost with his group.   
It seems that anyone dealing with VAR or EOL is likely to need some Java 
skills, so I think it would be a good investment.

I have not been able to schedule a review with Peggy yet, as I am still 
trying to schedule a trip to Calgary so that Peggy and I can do her review.  
She will be out of town from March 1 through March 11, so I will have to come 
to Calgary sometime after March 11.  I was in South America last week, and 
have been to London and Helsinki twice since mid-January, so scheduling

Max - Hi there, sounded like (from Jaime) you guys have had a busy week with 
various government officials.  I hope the result was good.

We all had a really helpful meeting here in Houston with those guys, and I 
just wanted to let you know that we have found a person to focus time on 
Mexico and work with Jaime and Agustin.  He is bi-lingual and very excited 
about the prospect.  We expect him to be proactive and help out quite a bit 
with setting up the new Mexico trading legal entity.   I have no doubt that 
this will fix most of the little issues that we discussed.  

We also assigned someone to come to Monterrey to set up Jaime and Agustin 
with system access where appropriate, and especially access to Livelink, our 
automated contract viewing system.  This should facilitate access to all 
Mexico contracts online (originals kept in Houston), and there should be no 
need to keep hard copies in Mexico.

Please let me know if you see any other areas where Energy Ops can help, or 
should be more involved.  

Beth

Augustin/Jaime,

I just wanted to let you know that Gordon has accepted our offer to take on 
the new position supporting your trading organization.  He is very excited 
and looks forward to working with you both.  

We are going to work on a transition period for him.  He is currently 
finishing a project on Paper and Pulp settlements to automate those 
processes.  He would like to finish this process before he takes on his new 
assignment full time.  He anticipates the completion of the automation to be 
within the next few weeks.  In the meantime we will work on having him 
cross-train for his new responsibilities.

Please let me know of any questions that you have.

Hey freak:
So we finally had LA type weather here for the past two days.  Highs in the 
mid-70's.  Beautiful.  Life's just cruising along.  Nothing new.  I put a bid 
in for a condo in a new mid-rise building going up in West U that they 
accepted.  If all goes as expected I'll move in next X-Mas.  So are you 
adjusting to the big city.   Got yourself a big Hollywood actor boyfriend yet?

Jacques,

I think we reached an agreement with George and Larry to pick up the items of 
value and not pay any fees for their time.  It looks as if we will be able to 
use everything they have done (engineering, architecture, survey, 
appraisal).  One point that is unclear is they claim that the $15,000 in 
extensions that they paid was applied to the purchase price of the land like 
earnest money would be applied.  I looked at the closing statements and I 
didn't see $15,000 applied against the purchase price.  Can you help clear 
this up.

Assuming we clear up the $15,000, we need to get the property released.  
Keith and I are concerned about taking over the Bishop Corner partnership and 
the risk that there could be undisclosed liabilities.  On the other hand, 
conveyance of the partnership would be a time and money saver if it was 
clean.  What is your inclination?

Call as soon as you have a chance to review.

Kay:

Attached please find an initial draft of the First Amended and Restated
Limited Liability Company Agreement for Project Blue Dog.  I am also
including a marked copy of the same that illustrates all of the
modifications that I made to the Delta form that you e-mailed to me
yesterday.

Two questions came to mind as I was preparing the draft.  First, if, as
stated in Section 2(b) of the Letter Agreement, the Turbine Contract is
between LLC and GE, why does the ENA have to cause the LLC to acquire such
rights?  No immediate answer jumped out at me upon reviewing the Turbine
Contract.  Second, I wasn't sure if the year in Sections 6.2(a) and (c)
needed to be 2001 or 2002.  Please let me know.

Regards,

Marisa

Subject: Executive Reports Add-In

Attached is the latest version of the Add-In for publishing Executive 
Reports.  It contains the ""Pulp & Paper P&L"", ""Pulp & Paper Position"", ""Pulp 
& Paper Price"", ""Emissions Summary"", and ""Natural Gas Net Fixed Price 
Positions By Book (Ignores Correlation)"" subroutines.

John Lavorato is expecting to see these publish reports in the updated viewer 
tomorrow morning!

To use this latest version of the Add-In:

Close all instances of Excel.
Detach the attached websave2.xla file into the Microsoft Office's Library 
directory.  Usually this is C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office\Library
Launch Excel.
Under the Tools menu selection, select Add-Ins...
In the ""Add-Ins available"" list, look for ""Websave.""  If present, uncheck 
it.  This is the old version of the add-in.
There should be a ""Websave2"" in the list.  This is the current version of the 
add-in.  Check it and click the OK button.

I've also attached a workbook containing a buttons for the new reports that 
you can copy and paste into your production workbooks.  



Here are the named range values and the sheet names for the reports:

Named Range	Sheet Name
nr_NGFixPB  	Natural Gas Net Fixed
nr_EmSum  	Emissions Summary
nr_PPPL  	Pulp & Paper P&L
nr_PPPos  	Pulp & Paper Position
nr_PPPrice  	Pulp & Paper Price

I've roughed out a document for you to discuss.  It isn't in good enough 
shape to go to Peoples yet, but hopefully it gives you something to discuss 
internally so we can decide what we want to do. In the meanwhile, I'm going 
to continue to think through the issues.

Again, we may want to take advantage of the recent bump in gas prices due to 
the cold snap, to minimize our fixed gas payment and heat rate with ECS.  At 
the very least someone should have the mandate to keep their eye on prices 
and determine when to lock-in.  

Take a look at the attached presentation.  Effect of changing gas prices on 
Gallup is demonstrated on the first page lower left table.  Give me a call if 
you have any questions.

Fixing the PG&E topock curve to Socal less .25 would only allocate more

Hi Steph, I don't know if this question should go to you.  If not, please 
forward it on to the right person and let me know who that is.

The reservation volumes on the seasonal contracts do not look correct.  The 
demand charge looks OK, its the demand volume which is not calculating 
correctly.  And ENA has released this capacity to Energy Express effective 
June 1.

Please look at the following contracts/deals.

Kay - 

I just spoke with Marvin, he seems pretty happy--just a few comments so far:

? the arbitration/dispute resolution clause needs to reflect what is in the 
LOI
? weekends are not included in the definition of off-peak hours


Marvin, David and Robert are still reviewing and look to have additional 
comments by early next week.

Fred,

As we discussed, we need the physical addresses where the equipment in 
TurboPark is being stored.  As I understand it the equipment is in at least a 
couple of places, and we haven't advised the banks of that fact.

BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS

OIL PRODUCTS
Congratulations to the US Oil Products Trading Team!  On October 4, 2000 th=
ey=20
successfully completed a deal with a volume of 2,400,000 barrels with a=20
Notional Value of $80,640,000.  This is the highest Notional Value associat=
ed=20
with an EOL trade.

Kudos again for another great deal. They have done another large=20
crack-spread, this time for 100,000 barrels per month for calendar 2001. Th=
is=20
trade notionally values out at over $40 million and is the second largest=
=20
transaction conducted to date on EOL.

STEEL
Steel Trading and Origination teams, headed by Greg Hermans and Tim=20
Battaglia, respectively, have already defined a Hot-Rolled coil financial=
=20
product.  The contract has been drafted and is currently being discussed wi=
th=20
customers.

Financial Hot Rolled Steel will be posted on EnronOnline, allowing the stee=
l=20
industry to hedge their price exposure for the first time in history. The=
=20
access to hedging products will help the steel industry manage technicaliti=
es=20
and smooth cash flow.  Over time, forward price curves with transparent=20
pricing should allow the steel industry to also benefit from improved acces=
s=20
to capital.

The next challenge will be to educate the steel industry about financial=20
swaps and derivatives as risk management tools.  The $300 billion steel=20
market should provide an excellent growth opportunity for Enron.

PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS
FuelCell Energy, Inc. recently announced that it has entered into an allian=
ce=20

Gentlemen,

As Dave and John know, I'm working on a deal for ENA (and with Jude) which 
has as one aspect a cost plus EPC contract for the construction of a power 
plant.  We need to put together the T's and C's for a cost plus contract, and 
since it is possible that NEPCO might be the contractor, I wanted to use 
something that is acceptable to NEPCO.  I will then take the laboring oar in 
order to get a working draft prepared for this project.

As always, I'm on a short time frame, so your response would be appreciated.

Thanks,

Kay",high,low,high

The 30th of July works great for me.  The interns should still be around and 
it would be a great way to end the summer.  I will put
a list together of recent graduates and send that to you.  I will also 
contact Shelly Jones and get a list of those starting in July.  I think 
it would be a good idea to include  friends/dates.  There are not that many 
of us Sooners here and we have met  most of our friends 
at Enron.  Let me know of anything else I can do.

Thanks Again,

Jeff,

I would like to invite you to an off-site meeting of John Griebling's 
organization
and the Research Group. 

Date:   April 27 - April 29
Location:  Breckenridge, Colorado


As you know, John Griebling is managing the network design and construction 
project
currently under way in EBS. The Research Group is actively involved in this 
effort
which requires advanced quantitative skills in the area of stochastic 
optimization and
stochastic processes (for modeling and forecasting Internet traffic flows).

The objective of this meeting is to develop common language and accomplish 
transfer 
of skills between the two groups, to facilitate cooperation on this project 
in the future.

We are also inviting to this off-site senior management of EBS and plan to 
have
on the agenda several presentations about strategic directions of EBS. The 
effort
of network design and construction currently under way is  unprecedented in 
terms
of its scope and complexity and it is important  for technical people, who 
often have
highly specialized technical skills, to understand the broad picture.

I would appreciate if you could join us for Friday afternoon (April 28) and
Saturday (April 29). I understand  that you have commitments on Thursday and 
Friday 
morning. We have reorganized the tentative agenda of the meeting to devote
Friday afternoon to more general topics.

Vince

Please let me know if these drafts have been superseded or not.

Also, I understand from Ben that the deal with Coral is scheduled to close on 
Thursday.  I would like to know on a more definitive basis if this is indeed 
true.  NRG remains very interested in the equipment.

Please advise.

Osman,

This guy is too much.
I would tell him that we understand
that he has to make the best choice
for himself  and can change his mind  but at this point we treat 
his decision as final but we still  appreciate the interest he showed
in Enron.

We never had any luck hiring a statistician.
Maybe we shall get one some day.

I'm attaching the final forms of the assignment/assumption agreements for 
GE's acknowledgement.  It is pretty close to what you saw last week.  It 
would be a big help if we could have these executed  by GE today or 
tomorrow.  A faxed signature would work, then we could have the originals 
picked up from Lee's office.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,

We need something from TCO to confirm that we matched those bids and have that

We actually forced Craig Breslau and Fred Lagrasta to unwind an unapproved 
one year trade with their subsidiary Savannah Foods in April 2000.  In 
hindsight, it appears to be quite a good call.

FYI, Imperial Holly Corporation filed for Chapter 11 protection yesterday.  
Counterparties affected would be:

  Imperial Holly Corporation
  Holly Sugar Corporation


At the present, we have no trades with either of these counterparties.

Subject: Sabotage Acts

Argentine Power Market update:
A series of sabotage acts occurred last Tuesday, putting the whole Argentine 
Electric System in danger of collapsing. The problems started at 8:30 PM when 
one of the 500 kV lines from the Comahue region went down. Around 10:30 PM, 2 
other lines went down as well, all in the Comahue-BsAs corridor. All 3 
incidents were due to sabotage acts, in which the tensiles holding the high 
tension towers were sawed.
In addition to the transmission lines sabotage, at 10:00 PM, one of the 
Nuclear plants suffered technical problems and kicked out 640 MW.
This situation created a huge swing in the frequency of the system and an 
overload of the 4th line from Comahue, which finally went out of service as 
well at 1:30 am, and was out of service for 1 hour. This last event kicked 
out the exports to Brazil which were at 1040 MW.

As a result of all the above power prices reached $170 per MWh during 11:00 
PM.
Transmission lines are expected to be re-established by Saturday.

For who might be interested, below is a detailed document and map showing the 
sequence of incidents and the damages caused (in Spanish).

Subject: A Computer and Internet Connection for You and Your Family

As you know, technology is critical to Enron; it drives our success and wil=
l=20
continue to do so in the future. Technology has helped Enron create new=20
businesses like Enron Broadband Services and Enron Net Works, and it is=20
responsible for applications such as EnronOnline and EnronCredit.com.  You=
=01,ve=20
seen what technology can do at work.  Now we want you and your family to=20
realize its benefits at home.

With that in mind, we are excited to let you know that we are introducing t=
he=20
ClickAtHome
program, which will give each employee a computer for use at home. Where=20
technology permits, we will also subsidize an Internet connection. With the=
=20
click of a mouse, a home computer plus Internet access will put a world of=
=20
Internet knowledge at your family=01,s fingertips. =20

We have just signed an agreement with Dell Computer Corporation to provide=
=20
the computer hardware. We wanted to let you know about the program now in=
=20
case you and your family were considering the purchase or upgrade of a home=
=20
computer or Internet connection in the next few months. The scope of=20
ClickAtHome includes the following:

? Basic package: Dell desktop computer with a high-speed processor, floppy=
=20
disk drive, mouse, speakers, monitor, modem, CD-ROM drive and Windows 2000=
=20
software. Employees will have the option to receive a subsidized Internet=
=20
connection, including broadband, where commercially available.
? Participation: This program will be available to active regular full-time=
=20
and regular part-time employees of Enron and its wholly owned subsidiaries;=
=20
however, employees of some Enron companies (Portland General Electric, EOTT=
,=20
Enron Facility Services) may not be able to participate due to legal,=20
accounting, tax, labor or business reasons.  Eligibility includes being=20
employed at the time of implementation. =20
? Timing: U.S. employee sign-up will begin in early 2001, with delivery of=
=20
the equipment and Internet connection to follow shortly thereafter.  Delive=
ry=20
of equipment to participating non-U.S. employees is targeted for late 2001.

Details about this program are still being finalized.  To address some of=
=20
your initial questions, we=01,ve posted a question-and-answer document on=
=20
http://clickathome.enron.com.  We will schedule an eSpeak session in the ne=
ar=20
future where you will have an opportunity to ask questions. Or, you can=20
submit your questions and comments to ClickAtHome@enron.com.=20

We are excited to extend our investment in technology to you and your=20
family.  We believe this program takes communication at Enron to a new leve=
l=20
by creating endless possibilities for you to experience and participate in=
=20
the broadband Internet revolution. It is just another reason why we believe=

Enron is a great place to work.",low,low,

What CRAP!!!  They have no political voice and the machines are old, give me 
a break!  They didn't have a problem electing more blacks to their 
legislature, so I guess they weren't denied the right to vote.  That last 
quote by Jackson!!!  Oh my goodness, cry me a river.  

I can't believe they can even say all this crap with a straight face.  But 
then I'm sure I'm prejudice.  

Don't send me any more of this crap today.  I'm trying to enjoy my Friday.  
I'm headed to Ruston this weekend.  I'm going to see Tech and Tennessee.  I 
think I told you that already.  I'm going to visit Fake family while I'm

=20
With the campaign going on-line with electronic pledging, I=01,ll need the=

Here's all my trip information.  Do I need to highlight how long the flight 
is so you'll know when to come pick me up??  How's your day going?  Mine's 
really quiet.  In fact everything went so smoothly this morning that it made 
me nervous.

Sounds like a good match with Ruthie and Murphy.

My old dog, Kaley, is really sounding bad.  She has a cough that just won't 
quit, which has gotten worse over the last couple of years.  I think it is 
her heart.  She's 11 years old, and moves slowly.  

Rosco owns the familiy now.  He is so quiet, but friendly.  Just likes to 
hang around close to everyone.  I'll miss him when I'm in FW.

Are you having fun yet!!!!!!

The vet said Murphy has an ear infection so that's probably why he's been 
scratching.  Otherwise, he's in great shape.  31.5 pounds and he also thinks 
Murphy is less than one year old.  He said Murphy is a wire terrier cross.  I 
looked that up, and it's an ugly dog!  He definitely doesn't have that face, 
it looks more like a Jack Russell.  You should have seen him running behind 
Ruthie this morning.  All four legs were off the ground - he definitely has 
kangaroo in him!  He must have had a rough day though because Ruthie was 
wanting to mess with him, and he snapped at her.  He's like Ric, you can only 
push him so far!  I'll try and take some pictures this weekend.  Just thought 
I'd update you on the kids!

Do you need something for lunch?

Daren - meter 1517 has a nom of 0/day for Jan.  It flowed about 5.400 on day

Just in case you're checking your e-mail in between spa sessions, here's an 
update:

The BPA Business Plan has not yet arrived.
Sir Speedy just arrived with copies of the EIS, which were supposed to be 
finished at noon.

So I'm a little frustrated with this lack of efficiency. I've left a message 
at BPA regarding the whereabouts of our order; I've scolded Sir Speedy for 
the delay; and one way or another I'll get the documents out to Terrell Gault 
and Jim Fell tomorrow.

I'm sure the last thing you want to hear while you're escaping from it all is 
that things aren't going according to planned back in the office; but I 
thought you should know just in case you hear from either of these guys. 
Nothing to worry about, though. You can now resume your poolside position.

Subject: Need your help representing your Analysts

As you probably know, the Western Hemisphere A&A PRC will be held in Houston 
on July 19th.  Each member of the PRC committee will represent 15 to 17 
analysts that have been randomly assigned. I've been selected as a member of 
the Analyst PRC Committee representing participants that are under your 
direct supervision.  As a PRC rep, I will continue to represent the assigned 
Analysts (see list below) during their entire tenure with the Analyst Program.

Thus, I need your help in supplying me performance information for these 
candidates (including pre-ratings if available) and recommendations for 
promotion if he or she is eligible.  In addition, for those of you based out 
of Houston I'd like to meet with each of you individually (15 or 20 minutes 
should be enough) during the 17th and the 18th of July (if you are not based 
out of Houston or you'll be out of town during those days, we can certainly 
do it over the phone the week of the 10th.
I'm based out of Sao Paulo (in transition from Buenos Aires) and I'll be 
landing in Houston the morning of the 17th, so I'll be ready to begin these 
short meetings by 11am on the 17th.  I would very much appreciate if you can 
indicate your time preference for those two days. 

FYI, the following is the list of participants that I'll be representing in 
the July 19th PRC meeting:

Analyst Name    Supervisor
Ahanchian, Amir Cyrus    Humphrey, Gene
Allen, Margaret     Palmer, Mark
Ashmore, Garrett    Cox, David    
Benien, Michael     Moscoso, Michael
Black, Robin     Lewis, James

Mena, Luis     Leibert, Richard
O'Malley, Justin     Pittenger, Cathy
Scarborough, John    Courtney, Mark
Vegalara, Mateo    Thomsen, Jon


Please call me at 5511-5503-1397 in Sao Paulo or at 5411-4891-3600 in Buenos 
Aires.  It will be of enormous help if you can let us know the name and 
telephone number of your assistants so Marianne Arake (Sao Paulo 
5511-5503-1197) and/or Nadia Rodriguez (Buenos Aires 5411-4891-3644) can 
follow up on the schedule in Houston.

Thanks for your co-operation.

I created deal #439909 for August.

Jeff - I am assuming that the price for August is Gas Daily.  Currently, we 
have the September deal priced at Gas Daily also.  Since this was flowing on 
the first, should the price be at Inside Ferc HSC for September?

You know how much I loathe these meetings with the Hee-Haw gang.  This 
telecon/videocon will likely degrade into a raucous Omaha-led circle jerk 
with everyone else, mostly the Houston group, trying to get a word in 
edgewise.  Is there any way to make this more fruitful?

If we do this, and you want to include me, you'll have to put it together 
before close of business Friday as I'm out all next week for surgery.

Subject: Capacity Options on TW

Attached is a preliminary draft of a filing for capacity options on 
Transwestern.  The attachments include a filing letter, proposed tariff 
language and a proposed form agreement.

Obviously there are still quite a few details to be worked out.  I am 
distributing a draft at this early stage in hopes of initiating a dialogue 
about the larger issues first.  A few that come to mind are whether we want 
to commit to selling options online, how best to explain or justify the 
option fee, and what specifically in the industry has changed such that FERC 
should depart from existing policy and allow TW to essentially reserve future 
capacity for shippers.  Please let me know your thoughts on these and any 
other issues.  

I would prefer to wait to discuss comments on wording, other conforming 
changes to the tariff, and other comments concerning form until after we have 
resolved the substantive issues.  Thanks.

Attached is a copy of the last draft of the LLC Agreement prepared by
ENA which I have revised to incorporate the changes discussed in your
recent telephone conversation with Doug Pedigo.  In the interest of
time, I have not revised the attached LLC Agreement to reflect the
substitution of Sweetgum for Tejas.

Section 6.1(c)(iii) was revised to reflect Sweetgum's right to freely
assign its LLC interest.  Section 6.2(a) was revised to reflect
Sweetgum's right to exercise the call at any time if it either obtains
or waives the GE consent.  Section 6.2(c) was revised to allow ENA to
exercise its put at any time (i) if it obtains GE's consent in form and
substance satisfactory to Sweetgum in its sole discretion or (ii) after
all GE warranties have expired.

To expedite matters, I am forwarding these changes to you at the same
time I am forwarding them to Doug.

Westgate

Enclosed are demographics on the Westgate site from Investor's Alliance.
Investor's Alliance says that these demographics are similar to the package
on San Marcos that you received earlier.
If there are any other questions or information requirements, let me know.
Then, let me know your interest level in the Westgate project?

San Marcos
The property across the street from the Sagewood units in San Marcos is for
sale and approved for 134 units.  The land is selling for $2.50 per square
foot as it is one of only two remaining approved multifamily parcels in West
San Marcos, which now has a moratorium on development.

Several new studies we have looked at show that the rents for our duplexes
and for these new units are going to be significantly higher, roughly $1.25
per square foot if leased for the entire unit on a 12-month lease and
$1.30-$1.40 psf if leased on a 12-month term, but by individual room.  This
property will have the best location for student housing of all new
projects, just as the duplexes do now.

If this project is of serious interest to you, please let me know as there
is a very, very short window of opportunity.  The equity requirement is not
yet known, but it would be likely to be $300,000 to secure the land.  I will
know more on this question later today.

Sincerely,

George W. Richards

Joint Lead Manager - UBS Warburg (f/k/a PaineWebber)
UBS has served a lead manager for the last two NBP offerings that were=20

Co-Managers
Dain Rauscher and A.G. Edwards
Both firms have a strong mid-market presence and have demonstrated their=20
ability to place a significant number of NBP units in past offerings.  Thes=

so NBP will be able to leverage DR=01,s participation in future debt=20

Bank of America and First Union
Bank of America has been a significant provider of commercial banking=20
services to NBP and NBPL over many years, while First Union recently became=

an NBP lender in the March 2001 transaction.  Both have retail distribution=

Daren,

I'm looking into this deal.   There is no volume on this deal for January 
00.     Should this deal have had some volume on it.
It was never scheduled with volume  however, in January it received flow of 
3461 due to ranking in POPS.  It was taken to zero once the actuals came in.

Please let me know if you intended to have volume on this deal for Jan 00

This is the original memo sent to all the committee members from Dave.  I 
then sent out another one cancelling the Staff Meeting for all those not 
included in this memo. I also sent out a memo regarding the newly formed ENA 
Management Committee,  including the assistants,  so everyone would be on 
board.

Let me know if this isn't what you needed.

Subject: ENA Management Committee

As part of the restructuring between ENA and Global Markets and consistent 
with the view to increase our focus on building our core gas and power 
business, we have decided to re-formulate the ENA Management Committee.  As 
part of this change, each of you are invited to participate in dialogue and 
decisions which will impact the overall course of our business. Ultimately, 
this group is responsible for the overall financial performance and strategic 
direction of ENA.  The only structural committment to your time will be a 
pre-scheduled Management Committee meeting every second Friday afternoon 
starting at 2:30 PM until 4:30PM in 30 C2 (video conference room).  The 
Portland, Canadian and Mexican offices can connect via video conference.  The 
meetings wil focus on financial targets, deal flow, market opportunities, 
staffing and strategic direction.  The first meeting will be scheduled on 
this Friday.  

Everybody should make a serious committment to attend, to stay for the entire 
meeting and to be on time.

Jim,

1. I can confirm that CHARM does express traditional exposures in a VAR
format.  One of the beauties of CHARM is that it expresses any quantifiable
exposure in a VAR format, i.e. financial, insurance, weather risks.  In
addition, it has the capability of incorporating correlations between risks
- to the extent that they can be quantified.

2.  To get the ball rolling, I will send you a broschure of CHARM this
week. I also suggest a conference call with Carl Groth of our NY office.
Carl knows CHARM well and my thought is that we can give you some more
ideas of this product in order for you to decide whether or not you would
like to pursue a presentation. A presentation can be arranged at the
location of your choice.

Let me know if the above fits your purpose or if you would prefer to move
in another direction.

Regards,

Bertil

Tim, I would argue that we should pursue this business as long as a) we are 
being adequately compensated for the financing and underlying commodity risk; 
b) we have very good paper; c) we are dealing with solid credits and are 
charging an appropriate risk adjusted cost of capital for the underlying 
financing; d) we have the ability to syndicate the capital or funds flow 
position if needed to manage cash issues and e) that RAC is comfortable that 
we are reaching these goals.

Any imbedded financing or $5M or more should be DASHED.  David, Joe and Mark 
should be your key contacts to ensure we are adequately managing these issues 
but I do not see any fatal flaw in the strategy if priced/managed well and we 
watch the funds flow issues.

Delainey

We are seeing demand for more of these.  For example, Tacoma City Light is

Jacques,

Can you draft the partnership agreement and the construction contract?  

The key business points are:

1.  Investment is a loan with prime + 1% rate

2.  Construction contract is cost plus $1.4 Million

3.  The investors' loan is repaid before any construction profit is paid.

4.  All parties are GP's but 3 out 4 votes needed for major decisions?

5.  60/40 split favoring the investors.

With regard to the construction contract, we are concerned about getting a 
solid line by line cost estimate and clearly defining what constitutes 
costs.  Then we need a mechanism to track the actual expenses.  Keith and I 
would like to oversee the bookkeeping.  The builders would be requred to fax 
all invoices within 48 hours.  We also would want online access to the 
checking account of the partnership so we could see if checks were clearing 
but invoices were not being submitted.

Let me know if you can draft these agreements.  The GP issue may need some 
tweaking.

Maria and Drew, this is a long-winded e-mail but please bear with me...

The problem:

As you probably remember, several months ago several of us met to discuss the 
following language in the ROFR portion of Transwestern's tariff: ""if the rate 
bid exceeds the maximum tariff rate, then the rate will be considered to be 
the maximum tariff rate,"" and the additional frustrating language ""[a]ll 
available capacity shall be allocated under these procedures . . ..""  At our 
last meeting, we concluded that probably the best way to ensure that TW could 
capture the true value of the capacity would be to link the negotiated rate 
to index prices.  However, since this usually involves an unacceptable amount 
of risk to both the shipper and TW, the marketers haven't done any 
index-based rates and have no current plans to enter into any such deals.  I 
have been asked by the Commercial Group to revisit this issue and to think of 
other ways we could increase our ability to charge more than the maximum 
rate.   Ideally they would like to eliminate the language I've quoted above.  
However, my research has indicated that absent our 1) bringing about radical 
change in the way FERC thinks about recourse rates or 2) showing that TW 
lacks market power, we are probably stuck with this language.

Why the problem exists (you may already know):

Steve Stojic and I did some looking into why the language is in our tariff in 
the first place.  In the Alternative Rates Policy Statement (RM95-6-000), the 
Commission explained that it is willing to entertain individual requests for 
negotiated rates, but only where customers retain the ability to choose a 
cost-of-service based tariff rates.  ""[T]he availability of a recourse 
service would prevent pipelines from exercising market power by assuring that 
the customer can fall back to cost-based, traditional service if the pipeline 
unilaterally demands excessive prices or withholds service.  Thus, the 
recourse rate mitigates market power.""  

The Commission went on to confirmed that under ROFR provisions the highest 
rate that an existing shipper must match if it wishes to continue its 
transportation arrangement is the maximum tariff rate. This policy is clearly 
not limited to ROFR situations:  when capacity is constrained, a shipper 
willing to pay only the recourse rate cannot lose access to capacity merely 
because someone else is willing to pay a negotiated rate.  ""When there are 
more requests for capacity than there is capacity available, then the 
pipeline must allocate capacity among those shippers willing to pay either 
the negotiated rate or the maximum recourse rate, for example on a pro rata 
basis if required by its tariff.""  The example cited by the Commission:  If a 
pipeline has 100 Dth/d available and two shippers request that capacity, one 
who is willing to pay no more than the recourse rate of $5 and another a 
negotiated rate of $6, then each would be allocated 50 Dth/d on a pro rata 
basis (assuming the tariff provided for pro rata allocation and not some 
other allocation method such as lottery).  

When TW filed for authority to charge negotiated rates, it voluntarily added 
the statement that ""if the rate bid exceeds the maximum tariff rate, then the 
rate will be considered to be the maximum tariff rate.""  Presumably we had 
concluded that we needed to add this recourse rate related provision in order 
to receive negotiated rate authority.  

Solutions??

I would like to know whether you concur that changing our tariff language 
outright is probably out of the question.  I feel as if I've really been 
chasing my tail here.  I have owed Lindy an answer for some time now.  But I 
keep coming back to our having to prove lack of market power (which, Drew, is 
where I believe you were headed when we talked about this in mid-October).  
Steve Harris has asked whether we can just start small and remove the 
recourse rate cap as to only a portion of our system.  I think we would still 
have to show lack of market power in order to do this.  Do you agree?  Stojic 
warns that proving lack of market power is a lengthy and expensive 
proposition.  Might be worth it to us, though.

Another idea is to somehow provide shippers with an incentive to pay more 
than max rate.  After all, we do have authority to charge negotiated rates.  
We've seen one instance in which one of our marketers was able to get more 
than max rates for IT space based on good customer relations alone.  However, 
despite our wonderful relationships with most of our customers, it's unlikely 
we can pull this off with any consistency.  We wondered whether we might be 
able to get more than max rates in the context of an auction procedure.  But 
I just am not convinced we could get around the Commission's requirement that 
recourse rates be available.  That requirement has not changed.  Have either 
of you seen anything to the contrary?  

I would like to meet with you two, plus several others I have in mind, to 
discuss this, preferably early this week (Tues. or Wed.), but would like to 
discuss briefly with you first.  Please call me so we can talk for a few 
minutes.  Thanks.

Same city, different Westin.  This one is on the Riverwalk, the other was 
near the Hyatt.  I like San Antonio for the trip though.  Easy!

I haven't seen a contract yet on the original 33,000 on TW but Susan thought 
the deal was going to be done--she's checking to see where the holdup is.  On 
the El Paso capacity, Mavrix never submitted a bid.  I think the deadline got 
past us before we were ready.  df

Subject: Mavrix

Three to-dos on our Mavrix meeting:
1.  Follow up and make sure the officers get set up correctly.
2.  Talk to Perry Frazier in planning--he is keeping copies of the actual EBB 
postings showing that we have had the Ignacio-Thoreau piece of capacity 
posted (the 33,000/d).  I'd like you to keep copies of those postings in your 
file until Mavrix actually buys that capacity.  If we end up in a fight at 
some time, we'll be able to prove the postings were out there, because the 
actual postings are not electronically archived, I am told.
3. All Mavrix deals will need initials from legal--probably you, Susan.  For 
now, please let me know of any deals Mavrix does with non-Enron pipes.  For 
Enron pipes, of course, contract approval will be via our ordinary procedures 
and MKM's group and I should be advised as a matter of course.  

Thanks.  DF

I have attached a copy of a report that is given to John Lavorato every 
morning.  This report shows basis positions by trader for specific points.  
Please let me know if the positions we are reporting for the Canadian traders 
are correct.  If you unhide columns C-S you will find the curves that are 
added in each section.  The curves highlighted in green are used for 
intramonth positions and the white are the basis curves.   The intra-month 
position that shows is a combination of  physical and gas daily.  All other 
time periods are only basis notional.  If you have any questions give me a 
call.

I say go ahead with the call to work through any nits etc.  We will need a 
follow up call anyway, once we know what to do to meet the accting 
objectives.  This means you won't be available at 200 to talk with the accts, 
but that's ok.  

Finalizing the extension sounds good to me.

Hi there,

I am meeting with Ben tomorrow to discuss NWestern.  I'm fairly confident
that he will be willing to extend the letter agreement, but he hasn't
called me back today to confirm.

Ms. Kahn and I have exchanged voice mail.  Could one of you return her call
for me?  I'm tied up.  You might get an idea on some times tomorrow for a
call.  I'm booked until around 130 for anything which would last more than
a few minutes.  I'll check with Ben.

Thank you,

Kay

I will be at the meeting on Thursday.  I have asked Brenda Herod to attend as 
well.  Can you add her to your distribution list so that she receives notice 
of these meetings as well?  That way, one or both of us will be able to 
attend.  Thanks.

Subject: Dec. 7 - SDG&E Press Release


CRECers,

Note attached SDG&E press release calling on Governor Davis to use his
emergency powers to remedy the accelerating energy crisis by taking a
number of actions, e.g., directing local air districts to temporarily lift
emissions limits for in-state power plants so that the plants which have
met or exceeded their air-emissions limits can run.  In addition, SDG&E
reported it made an emergency filing with FERC requesting an immediate
reinstatement of price caps on interstate natural gas pipeline
transportation to the CA border.

Hey Eva,

Got your message, was waiting for you to write more.  I'll have to check with 
Sandra, but I haven't heard her say if she got your postcards.  

Robin came back from her honeymoon and you can't tell when she's blushing 
she's so red.  

The last two AGA's have been great.  One was a 40 cent move and the other was 
20 cents (what's better than Wednesdays?).

That's it for now.

Must go see Suey.

Dear Mr. Brannen,

Jeff has left for the day, so has not yet seen your note.  However, I wanted 
to let you know that the timing may not work on February 15.  He is attending 
a board meeting that morning, which is followed by a luncheon.  There is not 
much daylight in the afternoon, either, but I'll check with him first thing 
Monday morning to see if there is anything we can do to free up a few minutes.

Have a nice weekend.

EES sent over revised volumes for delivery at SP-15 after I sent the

Subject: Titan Land Development, LLC; Pontiac Letter of Intent

Ben:

Attached is the ComEd Letter of Intent to interconnect at the Pontiac TSS.  
Under the guidelines of Appendix K of ComEd's Open Access Transmission 
Tarriff, we are required to execute this LOI within 15 days of the date of 
receipt (7/7/00) in order to maintain our current position (6/12/00) in the 
ComEd queue.  If we execute after 7/22/00, then the date our date in the 
ComEd queue becomes the date of execution of the LOI.

Appendix K provides that once the LOI is executed, ComEd shall provide Enron 
with an Interconnection Study (IS)  and Project Diagram (PD) within 45 days 
(ComEd has the option to extend another 30 days, if needed).  The IS and PD 
will provide Enron with a description of the upgrades required and an 
estimate of the proposed allocation of the cost to interconnect.  The IS and 
PD do not provide Enron with information on transmission availability (ie 
ATC), this would be addressed by the Interconnection Feasibility Study 
currently in progress by ComEd (I am expecting the results of this IFS in the 
next 2-3 weeks).  

ComEd informed me in a discussion yesterday afternoon that their current 
interpretation of AppendixK provides that if the commercial start date of a 
proposed IPP project is delayed, that there is no impact to that proposed 
projects' queue position relative to competing projects provided that all 
interconnection milestones (LOI, PD, Notice To Proceed, and IA) remain 
current.  ComEd further indicated that such a delay would result in a project 
with an inferior queue position (i.e. Wizvest) being charged with the 
necessary system upgrade costs even though their project would come on line 
prior to the project with the superior queue position.  I will request that 
this interpretation be confirmed by ComEd in writing to Enron. (This 
interpretation obviously has a large value implication for the Torrence site 
relative to the Wizvest planned '01 interconnect).

I will review this letter on the plane to Houston this afternoon.  I believe 
that it authorizes ComEd to spend up to $100K on engineering related to the 
interconnect design.  It also addresses the ordering and payment 
responsibilities for long-lead equipment required to facilitate the proposed 
interconnection.  Based upon our development budget discussions earlier this 
week,  we obviously do not want to incurr long-lead equipment charges prior 
to having a clear value proposition in our sights.  I will have 
recommendations ready for you on these issues by Wednesday.  I am 
simaltaneously forwarding it to Kay Mann for her review so that we will be in 
a position to move forward to execution prior to 7/22 if we choose to do so.  
From a legal standpoint, this is ComEd's boilerplate LOI.  I believe that we 
executed a similar LOI for Wilton Center in early 1999 under Des Plaines 
Green Land Development, L.L.C. 

Call me if you wish to discuss.

Steve,

Thanks. I printed the fundamental info
last night and will wait for the open.

I negotiated a few contracts for  Enron's contribution to a book
(Enron was a sponsor).  It's not the same as negotiating as an author.

You can call a friend of mine, John Martin, and he will be able to help you.

Also, I just found out that Chonawee did not get his mid-year review.     I 
didn't realize that Samer Takriti never gave him a review.   I have found all 
of the mid-year feedback for Chonawee, but I don't have an official ""form"" to 
fill out for him to sign.   Can you send one to me, or what should I do?

would have been good with a tomato based pasta, I think.

How do I find out how much vacation I have?  I know there's a system on the

Congratulations ( I think?) on your new assignment.

If you get a chance in the next few days, drive by this building I have.  It 
is at 5205 Spruce (2 blocks north of Bellaire Blvd and 2 blocks west of Rice) 
in Bellaire.  It  is a great building for what you need for your cars.  It 
will lease for about $12-$15/sf annually (about 5000 sf including the garage 
space) and I have about $750,000 in the building.  If you have 1/3 of the 
building (+-$250,000) it will cost you about $1,600/mo in interest.  This is 
about what it would cost to put your 3 cars in a climate controlled storage 
space (probably less) at a USTOREIT.  Let me know if you're interested in 
looking at a deal structure.

Vicki, how much $$ are we talking about for the bankruptcy and the class 
action suit? It does not seem inappropriate for us to share the bankruptcy 
costs given the CTC issue.  I agree with you on the class action suit.  Lets 
discuss further before we approach ENA.

Subject: California bankruptcy expenses

I would like some guidance about  outside counsel fees related to the 
California situation.  We ( EES and ENA) retained joint counsel in early 
January. As you may recall, in January a substantial amount of work was done 
with the attempted rescue effort by the US Department of Treasury, and the  
managing down of the trading positions with PG&E's unregulated entity.  

I would say that  EES and ENA have used this counsel relatively equally, and 
it would not be inappropriate to split the bills on a  50/50 basis.  However, 
there are two other issues that we should consider: (a) on an overall basis, 
I would say that ENA will have more  issues  that will come out of the 
bankruptcy, and (b) certainly, they will be easier able to absorb as  a 
company  the increased legal expenses.  

Please let me know whether we should go forward with the 50/50 arrangement or 
whether we should adopt another approach.

One other fact:  We also have joint representation in the class action 
lawsuits filed against the power marketers.  To date, no sharing  has been 
agreed to, based on EES' position that in is improperly named in the lawsuit 
(i.e., it is not a participant in the wholesale markets and did not  benefit 
from the  volatility this summer).",medium,high,high

Dale,

My recommendation is to make Steve the head of the research unit in London.
We were talking originally about September but I think we should accelerate 
this process.
Of course, Anjam will be very unhappy about it, but we cannot manage around 
him
any longer.

I think that the promotion should be combined with a salary increase.
I would like to offer him a significant increase that
goes with expanded responsibilities and much higher visibility.
A salary increase will also bring him closer to the market.
 We see the market for  technical people going through the roof in 
practically every location
where we operate.

A contract is not a good solution in my view. It creates a sense of false 
security for
both an employee and the company.

I shall send a message to John Sherriff with my recommendation. I shall cc 
you.
I would appreciate if you could bring it up with John as well.

Vince

Hi Vince,

HR is working on a mid-year salary review for London people that have a 
noticeable gap between their compensation at Enron and what we would have to 
pay in the market for a replacement.  They highlighted Steve as someone with 
a potential gap - particularly in light of what we're seeing in our quant 
recruiting effort for credit trading and research.

I'd like your opinion on the best way to make sure we keep Steve happy and 
keep him at Enron.  There are several things I see we can do:

1)  Give him a mid-year pay increase to move him closer to market.  I'm not 
sure this is the best way to go, especially if we only offer him a token 
salary increase.

2)  Offer him more responsibility:  What are your thoughts on timing for 
making Steve the official head of the London research team?  With my move to 
EBS, should we accelerate this?  I think this is good way to keep him happy 
and motivated, and then follow up with a more meaningful salary review at 
year-end (as part of the regular process) that takes into account his greater 
responsibility.

3)  We have some people that we're trying to get under long-term (3-yr) 
contract with a 12-month notice clause.  Obviously anyone signing one of 
these will want significant up-front compensation for being handcuffed.  
We've not had a lot of success with these here in London, and I would prefer 
to keep Steve happy so he wants to stay with Enron rather than contractually 
binding him to the job.

I'd value your thoughts on this.

Thanks,

Dale

Subject: ENA v. Triad

 
 Scott and Tori: 

 I hope you are both doing well.  I have some questions for you about this 
matter that will help me on a jurisdictional legal issue:  

 1.  Can we say that for each of the spot gas sales that you made to Triad, 
Triad would have called you (or someone else with ENA) first, and that you 
would have taken the call in Houston?  I am assuming that this is probably 
the case, but I would like to get confirmation from each of you. 

 2.  Did Sherwood Purnell or anyone else from Triad ever come to Houston to 
meet with either of you (or anyone else with ENA of whom you are aware)?

 3.  Are there any other contacts between Triad and Texas that either of you 
are aware of?

 Many thanks for your usual quick response.

 Britt

 P.S. to Becky--I think you had some questions for Credit about how much is 
owed.  Can you please flange that down today or tomorrow?  I want to get the 
petition filed this week.

Chris--see Melissa's note below.....per her note it would appear that part of 
the capacity we valued in the Wholesale book (not Retail) was not really 
capacity they owned.  Can you give me the details on this capacity--what term 
they gave it to us for, rate, receipt and delivery points, volume, etc.  Then 
we need to look at what impact it will have to take it out of the book.  
Thanks for the help.

Colleen,

As I understand it, we were acting as Agent for TCO capacity owned by Titanium
Metals, and that capacity was incorrectly incorporated into the sale of our
Wholesale book.  Could you please look into this on your end and let me know
how to best proceed with correcting this situation.

Hi Jeff,

I need more in-depth information than what I could get from King & Spalding,  
so I asked around for a Mississippi firm.  Sheila suggested this firm, and 
Stuart said he thought they were an ok group.  As you can guess, it is a

Phillip,

Here's a copy of the spreadsheet we gave to Bill Bradford.  Our exposure  on 
the financial deals increased relative to the february spreadsheet from $45 
mil to $71.  Also, we have one physical deal (next winter), which is not 
physical storage, that is marked at $12 mil.  The spreadsheet shows five 
synthetic storage deals with PGE Energy Trading that may have the wrong 
counterparty in our system.  I'm at the office and will be here through the 
meeting.  My cell number is 832-444-7702 if you have any questions.

Chris,

   Columbia Marketing has some outstanding invoices from Jan - Mar of this 
year
for gathering and processing charges against contract 50140 IGS.  I talked 
with
Doug Kinney at CES, and he referred me to you.  Should Enron be paying these
charges?  Do you need me to send copies of the invoices to you, or do you have
an accounting contact for me?

   Any help you can give me would be greatly appreciated.

   PS  Credit tells me that the Jan Gulf invoice is outstanding, also.

Mike Moran has informed me that the FTC and U.S. DOJ, as part of their review 
of the El Paso-Coastal merger, have decided to take a close look at the 
merger's possible impact on competition in the Chicago-Wisconsin market.  In 
this regard, those agencies need to set up a conference call in the next two 
weeks to discuss that issue with experts on that market from Border and 
Northern.  This will not be an on-the-record deposition.  It will be a conf. 
call and what I expect to be an  informal question and answer session on what 
we know.   Representatives of the Wisconsin and Illinois Attorney General's 
office (or whatever agency it is in those states that deals with antitrust 
issues) will be on the phone as they are working with the Feds on the 
merger.  I think either one of you guys, with appropriate supervision, would 
do a fine job.  Please let me and Mike know who gets the black bean and what 
your general availability is and we'll get it set up.  Thanks. DF",medium,medium,

Wade, I have decided that everything currently in our system is incorrect.  
Please set up a meeting with all the people shown above and we will discuss 
how to correctly handle this in our system.  We also have some other supply 
behind the LDC that we might as well handle correctly.  
Wade, while we are at it, do you want us to look at NYSEG, CPA, and East 
Ohio??? Any others?

People I need in attendance
Mary Theresa or Jeanne
Steve Gillespie
Angie
Sylvia Campos (or someone from the contracts group)

This is what I'm thinking, everyone please think about this before we meet.
I think I will have Peoples set up as a pipeline and we will move all the 
deals to this new pipeline.  
Steve, get the Peoples password from Angie.  I need you to go into escript 
(Angie can help you with this) and run anything you can get out of this 
system.  These are actually CES passwords.  It is my intention to use this 
information to set up transport or pooling contracts in Sitara.

Subject: Re: Phillips Production Co - PNG City Gate Production  

Phillips Production has/had two seperate PNG deals:
 1.  500 MCFD; $2.82/MCF; 1/1/00 - 6/30/00
 2.  300 MCFD;  $2.95/MCF;  1/1/00 - 11/30/00
To my knowledge, PNG does not send out production information to either the 
producer or the pool operator.  This information should be available on 
E-Script.
 Phillips gets their production volumes (which they use to create our 
invoice) from the company integrating the meter charts.  I beleive that this 
is the same information provide to PNG.

Subject: Re: Phillips Production Co - PNG City Gate Production  

Wade,  Thanks for bringing this issue to our attention. But I need help 
understanding this one.  We have a process already to handle John's behind 
the citygate deals  

Since, the actual scheduling is done by CES in Virginia,  we never nominate 
this gas nor do we see actuals.  We hear about them from John and Terry and 
we are supposed to get confirms from the producer and CES.  Whenever one of 
these deals occurs, we have buys from the producer and sales to CES to 
account for these transactions internally.

It's my understanding that whenever John cuts one of these behind the 
citygate deals;  that Terry puts it into Sitara for him.  The offset also 
entered by Terry  is a sale to CES (Now the New Power Company effective Sept. 
1) with commercial (usually Chris Germany) confirming the sale price.  Angie 
schedules it in Unify under CNG and we create, track and balance like usual. 

Is that not the case here?  Is this something that's getting reconciled in 
Jeanne and Terry's project for CNG???

By cc: Angie, please get with Terry /Jeanne and Chris to help Wade.  THANKS!  
Please keep me abreast of the status.

Subject: Phillips Production Co - PNG City Gate Production

ENA is being invoiced by Phillips Production Company for production on  
Dominion Transmission (CNG) via Peoples Natural Gas.  This is 
behind-city-gate gas that we do not get documents supporting the volumes. I 
have invoices and production statements from Phillips.  

Per John Singer Notes Mail of 08/23 concerning the July production,"" Phillips 
Production / Peoples: Price:  @ $2.95/Mcf  Term:  1/1/2000 - 11/30/2000 Est. 
Volume:  500/MCFD  (Actual Volume will vary.)   I have no way of verifying 
the actual volume.  Chris Germany and Angie Zeman will try to get into CES's  
PNG pool via E-Script.  This may be the only way to verify actual volumes.  I 
have a call into Phillips to see if they might have a pipeline statement 
verifying volumes.""  Joihn's call to Phillips read partially,  "" I just 
talked to Sam Fragale @ Phillips.  The 7,843 Mcf @ $2.95 is ENA's. ""

Our deals have been using point 20200 on Dominion Transmission (CNG).  Deals 
for Jan 00 - Mar 00 were 210359 and 210364.  These were copied to 226543 and 
229733 respectively for April 00 forward  Deal 226543 has April 00 only, but 
should probably be extended through June-00 according to deal notes from John.
Here is our current status on this gas

Prod  Invoice  Invoice  Current  
Month  Volume  Price  Unify Vol Sitara Deal 

May-00  4801  @$2.82  163  226543 (has April-00 only, should extend through 
June?))
  9748  @$2.95  353  229733

June-00  5341  @$2.82  0  226543 (has April-00 only, should extend through 
June?))
  9394  @$2.95  0  229733

July-00  7843  @$2.95  9552  229733

We need to get our proccess together for handling this each month through the 
end of the deal terms.

Please direct the appropriate parties to help make these invoiced volumes 
available on the deal and in Unify so I can pay Phillips.

Thanks  WRP

Hi Matt,
Multiple values for parameters - sounds OK.  I'd add an extra run option to 
the menu bar, and you could set up a list of parameters on a separate tab, 
each line corresponding to a complete run.  How about a meeting tomorrow when 
you could tell me what parameters need to be varied?

Tom,

I took a few days off and just got back....

Anyway, I haven't tried it without the key, but if you say it works, then I'm 
sure it does.  One thing I'm realizing, though, is that it's taking me way 
too much time to babysit this thing through multiple runs of the model even 
when it does work.  In order to get the full benefit of your model I want to 
run it a zillion times for many different combinations of parameters.  So, if 
you haven't guessed already, I'm wondering how hard it would be to get this 
thing to zip through some preset combinations of parameters and save the 
results without me tending to it.  I envision a spreadsheet where I list out 
all of the parameter values for each run, and the model picks out the 
parameters, runs through a year's worth of data, and saves the summary sheet, 
then steps to the next set of variables.  In this way I could set it to run a 
bunch of times over night or something so it wouldn't tie up the work day.  
Would this be just a separate macro?  What do you think?

Mat

Hi Mat,
I took away your licence key from the back of your PC yesterday.  The 
problems with our network licence for the solver have gone away - I do not 
really understand what happened.  Try the model aand see if it works OK - 
runs fine on my computer now, whereas it did not run 2 weeks ago.  I suspect 
some sort of network problem, and IT have not been able to figure out any 
more likely cause.

That is actually the report I'm having problems with. The old EOL JF report 
on your desktop has somehow been replaced by the new stage version. It's 
trying to pull information from the C drive, which does not exist on terminal 
server. Nicolay is working with me to try to figure out why, but most likely 
they'll have to put the stage version into production in order for me to run 
this report again.

Dear Dorothy:

Thank you very much for your note; below I have laid out the agenda for the
meeting for Ken and Jeff's approval:

1. Introduction to Adventis and our work in the Broad band space; - 20 minutes
2.  Ken's brief on Broad Band Services group's way forward: challenges,
issues, aspirations; - 15 minutes
3. Jeff's expectations and views form the corporate center;-10 minutes
4. Adventis' approach, likely routes to partnership;-10 minutes
5. Next steps: JEFF, KEN and our team.- 10/15 minutes

During the second hour with Ken, we wish to address specific points on the
out come of the first meeting to define areas of focus for path forward:

1 Strategic and operational issues for short term value creation, and
long-term robust development of BBS as global player
2. Acceleration capacity at BBS to capture short range opportunities versus
outside assistance.
3. Likely ways we could engage with Enron for both short term and long-term
wins.
4. Time line for creating the upside.

I am sure Ken and Jeff, will have a lot to add. Please do let me know.

Dorothy, given the significant challenges and opportunities ahead for Enron
BBS, we will have four of our senior most partners with deep insights into
Broad band and ASPs/CSPs join the meeting. I will come the night before, if
possible to have dinner with Jeff and/or Ken. Please do let me know the
possibility.

Regards,

I spoke with Jake and Lee about the payment schedule.  Lee currently is happy 
to give us 6% to repay everything on 15 May.  I told him we were shooting for

existing payment schedule.  We can probably push him to get it earlier.

To: Distribution
From: Eric Benson

In doing some research for Dorothy regarding salaries charged to work orders, 
I was advised by Judy Lin and James Weitekamp with accounting, that we need 
to provide Judy Lin with a payroll fixed percentage distribution by 
employee.  For example:

RC - 0237 Eric Benson .10 Navajo Work Order (work order number)
    .90 salary charged to RC

The report to Judy should be for each employee within your respective RC's.  
I have the allocation or percentages for Lou's RC but do not have the 
percentages for Drew and Dorothy.  If you like, please provide this 
information to me and I will be happy to send the request on to Judy Lin in 
accounting who will make all necessary corrections for January and February 
payroll.

Vince, both Matt and April think that this type of research would be 
value-additive to EBS.  I will be out all next week in a meeting with John 
Griebling and other on a deal that is being worked out.  I understand that 
you are following up with HR on all of our summer intern offers. Please make 
sure Palo is given an offer and that he will work with April and Matt (he did 
talk to Matt) on the topics that April and I suggested.

Regards,

Ravi.

Looks interesting.

I would guess that there is a TON of research available (from @Home, AOL, 
Roadrunner, Real, Microsoft, etc.) on Broadband's impact on the strategic 
value of web properties.  Compiling this would be very helpful.

Actually, he would also be a good fit for helping to think ways to analyze

Stinson,

Thank you for your e-mail.  My phone number is (617) 492-9551.  

I graduated from Princeton University in 1996 (mathematics), and came 
straight to MIT for a
Ph.D. in Operations Management at the Sloan Schoolof Management.  In my first
three years I took all the required coursework in mathematics,
optimization, stochastic processes, etc., as well as a number of courses in
psychology (at MIT and Harvard).  I am working with Prof. Gabriel Bitran,
and I am interested in the mathematical modeling of service operations.  In
particular, I am interested in the interaction between customers and
companies (hence the interest in psychology).  The (tentative) title of my
PhD thesis is ""Pricing Substitute Products on the Internet"", and I am
sending you the summary which I sent to Tom Gros a few weeks ago that will
give you an idea of what this research is about.

Thanks again, and I'm looking forward to meeting you and your research
group next week.

Pricing Substitute Products on the Internet


Objective:

To develop new tools to decide pricing policies for goods and services sold
on
the internet.


Motivation:

This research is motivated by the fact that traditional choice and 
optimization
models are not appropriate for internet-related businesses.  The technological
innovations associated with the internet brought about an overload of
information
which inevitably affects the ways in which consumers make choices.
Furthermore,
companies have a great deal of influence on how much information consumers can
have access to.

The problem of pricing substitute products is an important strategic issue
faced
by internet companies.  Consumers usually search for generic products (e.g.
VCRs
or computers) without knowing exactly what they will buy.  Companies can show
different products and different prices to each consumer.  This type of
flexibility
was not available until the internet came about.

The problem of pricing substitute products is not unique to the internet.  The
methodology developed by this research should be transferable to a number of
other settings, such as pricing services.  Services are unique, and there are
many cases where customers will only buy one of many services offered by a
given company.  Our model will help companies decide which services to offer
to which customers and how much to charge for these services.


Research Strategy:

Our research strategy is to divide the pricing problem into two components
which can be combined to generate optimal pricing strategies.  These
components are choice models and optimization models.


Choice Models:

Choice models describe how customers make choices.  The management literature
draws on two main sources for these models: psychology and economics.  The
common approach in psychology models is to use what are called heuristic
elimination methods.  These methods consist of the elimination of options
based on the sequential elimination of features until only one choice
remains.
These methods tend to be very context-specific and do not lend themselves very
easily to mathematical analysis.  Economists focus on utility-maximing models
that are significantly more mathematically tractable than psychological
models.
The most common economic model of choice is the logit model.  The problem with
these types of models is that they are not very accurate reflections of how
consumer make choices on the internet.  The first step in our research will
be
to develop choice models that capture the interactions going on between
customers
and companies on the internet.

Optimization:

Traditionally, the optimization problem consists of maximizing revenue over a
certain planning horizon.  On the internet, the problem of maximizing revenue
still exists, but there is also a need to learn about customers.  Short term
profit is based on sales, but long term profit is based on how well you know
your customers and are able to retain them.  The optimization problem must
therefore include a short term component (sales) and a long term component
(learning).

What is your impression of why the NC attorney general's office has

(or any other intervenor) have any special rights to discover any of the

Mike and Mark-

I wanted to confirm with you that you have a 2 PM tee time on Wednesday, 
January 3rd at the Doral Resort and Spa's Blue Course (The Blue Monster).  My 
future father-in-law, Tom Neville, the Tournament Director for the Genuity 
Championships (formerly the Doral Ryder Open), has reserved your tee time and 
should you have any problems please contact him at the tournament office 
(305-477-4653 ext. 3058).

He also suggested that you might want to arrive a little early because there 
could be a possibility of teeing off a little earlier than 2 PM.  FedEx has a 
tournament scheduled beginning with shotgun start at 9 AM and depending on 
quickly they get around, you could get on the course before 2:00.  

Should you have any questions, please feel free to contact me here at work, 
(713) 345-8741, or on my cell phone, (713) 582-7596.

Hit it straight and Go Sooners!

Subject: CP&L Requests - Jan '00

Eric;

Two requests for the current Central Power & Light contract 96022030 - Sitara 
Deal 92399:

1.  For January 2000 volumes, we need a deficiency charge added in the amount 
of 12,231.85.

2.  For the entire length / term of this deal, the second step of the tiers 
or NNQ should have the rate handle associated with Gas Daily Houston Ship 
Channel HIGH for the day delivered less one cent.   This is per the 
confirmation Contract Price item 2.  The dollar impact for the incorrect use 
of the MID rate for Jan '00 is 6,395.23.  This same change in the rate handle 
should be made retroactively to November '99 and proactively through October 
'00.

Total dollar impact for January '00 = 18,627.08  added revenue.

Attached is the Jan worksheet.  Questions or comments, please let me know.

cc: James D Steffes/NA/Enron@Enron, Jay_dudley@pgn.com 
Subject: Re: Draft interconnection procedure  

Comments:

2.3     Delete last sentence.  If Enron is already in the queue (or 
considered in a queue) before a TP's interconnection procedures are filed at 
FERC, we don't want to have to resubmit something within 15 days in order to 
remain in the queue.  I don't think this is necessary and all are protected 
because pre-existing requests will be posted on OASIS on the queue.

4.3   Enron has argued for 60 days consistent with the OATT times (lost 
unfortunately).  It may look odd for PGE to ask for 90 days.  PGE is 
protected because if it legitimately takes longer than 60 days, you send a 
notification.

6    ((I realize that this language was included in CP&L, but recommend these 
changes for PGE.)

 6.1  Add after ""as modified by the Commission"" ""if Customer chooses to 
commence construction.""
6.2   Modify last sentence -- The Agreement will provide milestones toward 
placing the generator in service that the Interconnection Customer must make 
reasonable progress toward or it will lose its queue priority (after 
notification and opportunity to remedy.)

Thanks.

Since EPMI doesn't have any PGE interconnection requests pending, Jay Dudley 
agreed to allow us to review PGE's draft FERC interconnection filing.  As I 
mentioned to you on Friday, PGE is trying to file this week so we have a 
quick turn around time.  I'm going to try to read it today.

Mary - here is a draft of what the PGE interconnection procedure will be.
As I said, much of this is from VEPCO and Carolina Power.

Michele is redrafting it to be compatible with our OATT.

Let me know your comments as we want to file with FERC this week.

Thanks.

Jay.

Dear Ken,

We regret that your schedule did not permit you to visit with us this week
to discuss the Center's Global Change Program.  We do understand that the
White House probably has priority.

Rosalee indicated that you are available to meet at the Center on May 24th.
the day before the Board of Trustees meeting.  May I suggest that we invite
some members of the Steering Committee to join us on the 24th to review
where we are, the political environment, and continued Center involvement
in this program area.  As you are aware we have had discussions with the
Turner Foundation on a Leadership Forum and have developed several projects
which have each received partial funding commitments from the federal
government or private foundations.    Paul O'Neill, Tim Wirth, Bill Miller,
Teresa Heinz and Michael Oppenheimer are my suggestion of Steering
Committee members to join us.  Please give me your thoughts.

As always, Mary Hope

Subject: Re: Transwestern Alternative Operating Scenario


Larry- Thanks for the update. I am glad that the operating hours in the 
alternative scenario for BOTH STATIONS are agreeable to Transwestern. I will 
be sending the permits to EPA review today with a request for an expedited 
review.

The public notice period starts today, so i trust that the notice signs are 
posted outside your facilities.

Shudeish

Shudeish, the spreadsheets look great.  I spoke to the project engineer
about an hour ago and he told me that we can live with the numbers you have
given us in the permits for Stations 1 and 2 under the alternate operating
scenerio.  He has been in Boliva for the past 2 weeks and was unavailable
for comments.  Please accept my gratitude for all the extra work and effort
you have put in on this issue of operating hour under the alternative
operating scenerio.  We are going to accept the hours as stated in the
permits.  Thanks very much",low,low,
